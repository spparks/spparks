This example directory includes a Python script (Gcode.py) that can be
used to convert between G-code files generated by slicing software to
the laser path file format used by SPPARKS. It also contains an
example g-code file(20mm_cube.gcode).

The default G-code format the script reads can be generated using the
"RepRap" profile in the open source Slic3r program
(https://slic3r.org).

The laser path files used by SPPARKS are 5-column comma-separated text
files. The first 3 columns are x, y, and z coordinates that are
linearly interpolated between to define the scan path. The 4th column
is the cumulative distance of the scan path. The 5 column is the
"Pause Flag", which defines whether a laser is on (flag = 0), the
simulation is going through a long pause with the laser off as during
recoating (flag = 1), or if the simulation is going through a short
pause with the laser off as during repositioning within a layer (flag
= 2).
