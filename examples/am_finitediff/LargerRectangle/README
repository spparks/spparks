The current simulation input file is configured to only simulate the
first two layers of the build. The input path file (path.txt) has
specifications for 20 layers, and the entire build can be simulated by
lengthening the run time and increasing the size of the simulation
box's Z-dimension.

Running this example simulation in parallel is recommended for best
performance.
