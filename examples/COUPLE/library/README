This directory has a small collection of routines, useful for
exchanging data between 2 codes being run together as a coupled
application.  It is used by the LAMMPS <-> Quest and LAMMPS <->
SPPARKS applications in 2 sister directories.

The library dir has a Makefile (which you may need to edit for your
box).  If you type

make -f Makefile.mpi

you should create libcouple.a, which the other coupled applications
link to.

Note that the library uses MPI, so the Makefile you use needs to
include a path to the MPI include file, if it is not someplace
the compiler will find it.
