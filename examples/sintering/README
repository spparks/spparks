This sintering example script reads a gzipped data file CuO3.spins
which is too large (38 MBytes gzipped) to include in the tarball or
GitHub distribution.

To run the example you first need to download the CuO3.spins.gz file
from this link and put it in this directory:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zr-w54BM2KkahbeIKDFRjeYA4O64USmg/view?usp=drive_link

Then unzip the gzipped file:

% gunzip CuO3.spins.gz

Then you can run the input script.
