This sintering examples reads a gzipped data file via the read_sites
command.

The file is 38 MB in size and is too large to include in the
SPPARKS distribution.  You can download it at this Google Drive link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zr-w54BM2KkahbeIKDFRjeYA4O64USmg/view?usp=sharing

To read the file, SPPARKS must have been built with the -DSPPARKS_GZIP
option in the Makefile.

If you did not or cannot do that, you can uncompress the file
before running the iput script:

gunzip CuO3.spins.gz

and also swap the commented/uncommented lines for the read_sites
command in the input script, and then run the script using the
uncompressed file.
