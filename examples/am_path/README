This directory contains 4 subdirectories -- primarily associated 
with exercising the 'am path' command.  The examples in this 
directory may take 30 minutes to an hour running on 4 to 8 
processors.  Its best to run these examples on 4 or 8 
processors otherwise they may take nearly an hour or more to run.

There is a python script which may be used to 
visualize results for all of the tests provided the bounding 
box information is properly edited.

* cartesian_path_test; there are 8 very fast running examples 
demonstrating use of the 'am cartesian_layer' command; especially 
demonstrating starting the laser location at 'LL' lower left, 
'LR' lower right, 'UL' upper left and 'UR' upper right.  These 
use a test app which prints out screen information that may be 
useful for debugging layer and path inputs.

* path_raster_cartesian_LL; one example demonstrating use of 'potts/am/weld'
  app along with 'am pass' and 'am cartesian layer' commands.  This example
  creates a stitch file 'path_raster_cartesian_LL.st' which may be visualized
  using using the python script 'process_stitch.py' script.  

  % python process_stitch -ppath_raster_cartesian_LL

* path_raster_a; this example demonstrates use of 'am path' command as well 
as progressive IO using 'stitch'; there are two spparks scripts in the directory
which are intended to be run one after the other. Subsequently, the python 
script can be used to visualize the collective results from both simulations.

  % python process_stitch -ppath_raster_cartesian_LL

* pattern_repeat; this example demonstrates use of 'am build' command for 
creating repeating raster patterns comprised of multiple layers.  This example 
contains its own 'process_stitch.py' script which may be used to visualize 
resulting simulation.  Edit this script as necessary to visualize different
layers in the build.
