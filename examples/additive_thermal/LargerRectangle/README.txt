The current simulation input file is configured to only simulate the first two layers of the build. The input path file (path.txt) has specifications for 20 layers, and the entire build can be simulated by lengthening the run time and increasing the size of the simulation box's Z-dimension.

Running this example simulation in parallel is recommended for best performance.
