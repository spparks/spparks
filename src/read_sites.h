E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
line.

E: Cannot read Neighbors after sites already exist

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Can only read Neighbors for on-lattice applications

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Cannot read Neighbors unless max neighbors is set

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Must read Sites before Neighbors

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot read Values before sites exist or are read

UNDOCUMENTED
