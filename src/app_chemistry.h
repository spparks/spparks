/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
line.

E: Unrecognized command

The command is assumed to be application specific, but is not
known to SPPARKS.  Check the input script.

E: No solver class defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid volume setting

Volume must be set to value > 0.

E: No reactions defined for chemistry app

Use the add_reaction command to specify one or more reactions.

E: Species ID %s does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Reaction ID %s already exists

Cannot re-define a reaction.

E: Reaction has no numeric rate

Self-explanatory.

E: Reaction must have 0,1,2 reactants

Self-explanatory.

E: Reaction cannot have more than MAX_PRODUCT products

Self-explanatory.

E: Unknown species in reaction command

Self-explanatory.

E: Species ID %s already exists

Self-explanatory.
