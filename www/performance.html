<H3>SPPARKS Performance 
</H3>
<P>The plot below shows parallel efficiency for SPPARKS running a Potts
grain growth model with a KMC algorithm on a cubic lattice with 26
neighbors per site.  Four different size problems were run on varying
numbers of processors on Sandia's Cray XT3 (Red Storm) machine.  The
four problem sizes were 1 million lattice sites, 3.375 million sites,
8 million sites, and 1 billion sites.  Runs on 1 processor were
considered to be 100% efficient.  Thus a run on 100 processors with
parallel efficiency of 120% means that it ran 120x faster on 100
processors than it did on 1 processor.  Since the largest billion-site
problem could not be run on 1 processor, it's efficiency on 216
processors was estimated as the baseline measurement for the blue data
points.  Overall, the data indicate very large on-lattice problems can
be run on large numbers of processors with high parallel efficiency.
</P>
<P>Normally, a parallel code will fall off from 100% efficiency as a
problem is run on more processors.  In this case, the parallel
efficiency actually increases modestly across a wide range of
processor counts.  This is because a tree-based event selection
routine is being used in the KMC solver.  It's cost scales as log(N)
in the number of events N to select from, at each step.  Since the
number of sites per processor shrinks as processors are added, and N
is proportional to the number of sites per processor, the cost of
event selection decreases as processor count increases.

<P>The smallest problem (1 million lattice sites) was run in two
different modes, with DeltaN = 0.125 and 1.25.  DeltaN is the nstop
parameter in the <A HREF = "doc/sector.html">sector</A> command and determines how
long the KMC algorithm performs selection in one octant of a
processor's sub-domain before communicating and moving to the next
octant.  Thus runs with a small DeltaN perform more communication and
are less parallel efficient as processor count increases.

discussed in more detail in the technical report listed on
the <A HREF = "papers.html">publications page</A>.
