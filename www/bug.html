<H3>Latest Features and Bug Fixes in SPPARKS 
</H3>
<P>This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for
the SPPARKS simulator.
</P>
<P>To stay up-to-date with the current SPPARKS, you can download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html">download page</A> at any time, which
will include all the features/fixes listed below, and re-build SPPARKS
from scratch.
</P>


<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "version"></A>What version of SPPARKS do you have? 
</H4>
<P>A SPPARKS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  SPPARKS is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of SPPARKS contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run SPPARKS.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the SPPARKS directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the SPPARKS WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of SPPARKS. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have.

<P><B>21 Oct 2015</B>
</P>
<P>Updates to the new <A HREF = "doc/app_potts_grad.html">app_style potts/grad</A>
command.  There is now a examples/potts_grad dir with 3 examples of
how to use the application.  Some pictures and movies are on the
<A HREF = "http://spparks.sandia.gov/pictures.html">Pictures</A> page of the web
site.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.21Oct15">list of changed files</A> from the 8
Jul 2015 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>8 Jul 2015</B>
</P>
<P>Added a new on-lattice application, called <A HREF = "doc/app_potts_grad.html">app_style
potts/grad</A>.  It is a Potts model which allows
specification of linear gradients of temperature or mobility along a
given direction, which affects grain growth.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.8Jul15">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Mar 2015 version.

<P><B>18 Mar 2015</B>
</P>
<P>Aidan Thompson (SNL) upated the <A HREF = "doc/diag_cluster.html">diag_style
cluster</A> comand to also compute and output the
centroid of each cluster.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Mar15">list of changed files</A> from the 19
Nov 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>19 Nov 2013</B>
</P>
<P>Added a couple missing header files, due to the 5 Nov 13 change.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Nov13">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Nov 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 Nov 2013</B>
</P>
<P>Have now allowed SPPARKS to be released (only in certain cases, by
request) under the LPGL (GNU Lesser General Public License).  Some doc
pages and README and LICENSE files were amended to state this.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Nov13">list of changed files</A> from the 5
Nov 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>5 Nov 2013</B>
</P>
<P>Made the initial random number seed used by each of the <A HREF = "doc/solve_style.html">solve
styles</A> depend on processor ID, so that each
solver generates a different random stream.  For many models this
isn't needed, but if you start a simulation with a homogeneous lattice
on every proc, you need more randomness to avoid correlations between
processors.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.5Nov13">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Mar 2013 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Mar 2013</B>
</P>
<P>Added a Python wrapper to SPPARKS, along with documentation for how to
build SPPARKS as a shared library, how to use the library interface,
and how to couple SPPARKS to other codes.  See new additions to the
manual in these sections:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "doc/Section_start.html">Section start</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/Section_howto.html">Section howto</A>
<LI><A HREF = "doc/Section_python.html">Section python</A> 
</UL>
<P>Also see these new directories in the distro:
</P>
<UL><LI>python
<LI>examples/COUPLE 
</UL>
<P>The python dir has examples of Python scripts that invoke SPPARKS.
The COUPLE dir has an example of a coupled
SPPARKS/<A HREF = "http::lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A> application using kinetic
Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics.  It also includes a small library
that does communication of data back-and-forth between the 2 codes.

</P>
<P>Xiaowang Zhou (Sandia) ran into a bug with the
<A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command when it was calculating
lattice connectivity with periodic lattices defined for simulation
boxes that were specified at arbitrary positions (not at the origin).
Due to a round-off issue, site-to-site connectitivy was sometimes
mixed up.  This patch should fix the problem.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19May12">list of changed files</A> from the 18
May 2012 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 May 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Greg Ho (Lockheed Martin) identified a bug when lattice sites
(positions and neighbors) are read in thru a
<A HREF = "doc/read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command, as opposed to being
intialized thru a <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command and
just having their values setup via a read_sites file.  I believe this
bug was introduced by some of the changes to SPPARKS last fall.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18May12">list of changed files</A> from the 17
May 2012 version.

</P>
<P>Seyed Mehdi Vaez Allaei and Morteza Jalalvand (U Tehran) found and
fixed a indexing bug when using <A HREF = "doc/app_style.html">off-lattice
applications</A> and reading in per-site values from a
file via the <A HREF = "doc/read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command.

<P><B>16 May 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Craig Jolley flagged a bug with the <A HREF = "doc/solve_style.html">solve_style
linear</A> command, that can occasionally occur due
to round-off when adding up a long list of probabilities.  This patch
should fix it.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.16May12">list of changed files</A> from the 20
Jan 2012 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>20 Jan 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Changed the Makefile to use a Make.sh script for finding style files
instead of a Make.csh script.  Csh is no longer included in some Linux
distribution, but "sh" always is.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.20Jan12">list of changed files</A> from the 10
Jan 2012 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>10 Jan 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Eric Homer (BYU) suggested a change in the dump image command so that
it will be consistent with other views when viewed from theta = 0 of
180, which is nominally a degenerate view angle.  This patch attempts
to remedy that.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.10Jan12">list of changed files</A> from the 6
Jan 2012 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>6 Jan 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a glitch in the 4Jan12 patch and added a missing file
that didn't make it into the SVN repository.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.6Jan12">list of changed files</A> from the 4
Jan 2012 version.

<P><B>4 Jan 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Eric Homer (BYU) found and fixed a bug in the <A HREF = "doc/set.html">set site
range</A> command where the range of integer values was off
by 2 when using a lower bound.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.4Jan12">list of changed files</A> from the 3
Jan 2012 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>3 Jan 2012</B>
</P>
<P>Changed the format of error messages generated by SPPARKS to include
the source file and line #, which can be useful in debugging.  Also
included the explanation of the error messages in the header files of
each class, to make the code more self-documenting.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.3Jan12">list of changed files</A> from the 23
Dec 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>23 Dec 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Made some upgrades to the dump image command to make it more
compatible with other versions of the code base for this class.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.23Dec11">list of changed files</A> from the 27
Oct 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>27 Oct 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Made the length of the output string for statistics to be an
easily-changed setting in the src/output.cpp.  The default length is
now 4096 characters, which ought to be long enough for most
simulations.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.27Oct11">list of changed files</A> from the 24
Oct 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>24 Oct 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug in the new <A HREF = "doc/boundary.html">boundary</A> command which had
to do with hou neighbor sites were identified for on-lattice
applications when using lattices with multi-site basis sets.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.24Oct11">list of changed files</A> from the 23
Sep 2011 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to Antonio Gomez for finding and fixing the issue.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>23 Sep 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Added a "boundary" option to the <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command.  This allows boundaries to be drawn between adjacent sites
if their specified values are different.  It is useful for
visualizing the boundaries between aggregated groups of sites
when the colors of sites in the adjacent groups are the same.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.23Sep11">list of changed files</A> from the 22
Sep 2011 version.
</P>
<P><B>22 Sep 2011</B>
</P>
<P>There were still some glitches in the 20Sep11 patch
with respect to non-periodic systems.  Hopefully this
patch fixes the remaining issues.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.22Sep11">list of changed files</A> from the 20
Sep 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>20 Sep 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/boundary.html">boundary</A> command to allow specification of
non-periodic boundaries in an on-lattice application.  This affects
the way sites are created and eliminates site neighbors across
non-periodic boundaries.  See the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>
and <A HREF = "doc/read_sites.html">read_sites</A> commands for more details.  Using
<A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites region</A> is now supported to only
create sites within a geometric region.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.20Sep11">list of changed files</A> from the 2
Sep 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>2 Sep 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed an indexing bug in the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Updated the input scripts in the examples to reflect the new syntax
for the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.2Sep11">list of changed files</A> from the 29
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>29 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Upgraded the dummy MPI library (used with make serial) to
be compatible with the 64-bit options now available in SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.29Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 25
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>25 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Added a sweep counter back to the output stats for sectored
KMC solves.  Somehow this got lost from an earlier version.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.25Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Enhanced SPPARKS to be able to run arbitraryily large models with more
than 2 billions sites, limited only by the physical memory on your
machine.  This requires use of 64-bit integers to store site IDs and
various system tallies, like the number of accepted and rejected
events.
</P>
<P>The data types for this are now defined in the file src/spktype.h,
which by default is set to allow for large problems.  To reduce memory
usage or for machines or MPI implementations that do not support
64-bit integers, you can revert to 32-bit integers by editing that
file.  See <A HREF = "doc/Section_start.html">this section of the manual</A> for
more details.
</P>
<P>There is still a limit of around 2 billions sites per processor, which
should not be a restriction since that would have a huge memory
footprint to store neibhbor lists.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 16
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>16 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>More upgrades to the <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump_image</A> command,
including an option to generate a list of random colors via the
<A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify scolor</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.16Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 15
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>15 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a glitch in the color table map for the <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>With considerable help from graphics whiz Nathan Fabian (Sandia), we
added a <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump image</A> command with accompanying
options settable via the <A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>This enables you to write out a series of high-quality, ray-traced JPG
or PPM images of the collection of sites from lattice-based
applications.  Of course, this does not replace the need for a
full-featured, interactive post-processing visulization capability,
but it does provide a simple, easy way to quickly see how your
simulation is working, since there are numerous tools that can display
individual image files or animate a series of them.  It is also
convenient for very large models, as a replacement for large dump
snapshots.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page includes a couple sample
images you can view.
</P>
<P>As part of this command, the previous <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command now
requires a "style" argument, which can be either "text" or "image".
The previous dump command is now the "text" style.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Jul 2011 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed some problems with the <A HREF = "doc/solve_style.html">group-style
solver</A>.  This includes one accuracy bug with the
way changed propensities were assigned to new groups, and some
bookkeeping changes for how zero-valued propensities were handled.
The specified <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> bounds can now be exact matches to event
propensities of your model.  A warning message is printed if generated
propensities violate the specified bounds.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.7Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 5
Jul 2011 version.

<P><B>21 Mar 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Enabled the region option on the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>

</P>
<P>Added an <A HREF = "doc/app_potts_strain.html">app_style potts/strain</A>
application to model grain growth in the presence of a strain value at
each lattice site.  If SPPARKS is used as a library, then the strain
values can be updated dynamically by another application, such as
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A>, via a driver code.  The LAMMPS distribution includes
an example coupling program that does this, in its "couple" directory.

<P>In collaboration with Corbett Battaile (Sandia), added commands for
<A HREF = "doc/app_erbium.html">app_style erbium</A>, <A HREF = "doc/diag_erbium.html">diag_style
erbium</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/event.html">event</A>, to enable
on-lattice modeling of reaction/diffusion events for hydrogen and
helium in a fcc erbium lattice.  A further description of the model is
given on the <A HREF = "pictures.html">Pictures & Movie</A> page.

<P>Fixed a bug with the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>
command when building a lattice with an application
that stores 2 or more integers or doubles per site.

<P>Greg Wagner (Sandia) identified two bugs with the <A HREF = "doc/set.html">set
region</A> and <A HREF = "doc/create_sites">create_sites</A> commands, the
latter when using a region whose lower left corner was not at the
origin.  This upgrade fixes the problems.

<P>Fixed a bug with using <A HREF = "doc/sweep.html">sweep color</A> with
<A HREF = "doc/sector.html">sectoring</A> in parallel.  The problem was that the
inter-sector communication was not complete.

<P><B>14 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.
