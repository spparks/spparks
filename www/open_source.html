<P>(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend SPPARKS in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>(2) If you distribute a modified version of SPPARKS, it must remain

SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>(3) If you release any code that includes SPPARKS source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.
</P>
<P>(4) If you give SPPARKS files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.
