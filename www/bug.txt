What version of SPPARKS do you have? :h4,link(version)

A SPPARKS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  SPPARKS is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of SPPARKS contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run SPPARKS.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the SPPARKS directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the SPPARKS WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of SPPARKS. :ulb,l

[24 Feb 2016]

Added {cwrap} and {dwrap} keywords to the
"dump_modify"_doc/dump_modify.html command to allow very large
per-site color or diameter values to be wrapped into a smaller set of
color or size values when rendered by the "dump
image"_doc/dump_image.html command.  This allows, for example, 2
billion possible spin values to be drawn as one of 10000 colors,
instead of requiring memory allocation for 2 billion colors.

Also fixed a bug to allow the dump command to printing a 64-bit site
count (> 2B) correctly without integer overflow.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Feb16 from the 1
Feb 2016 version.

:line

[1 Feb 2016]

Changes to enable 64-bit site IDs and thus to run problems with over
2^31 ~ 2 billion lattice sites.  There is now a -DSPPARKS_BIGBIG
compiler flag to enable building SPPARKS with support for the 64-bit
IDs.  See the "Section_start.html"_doc/Section_start.html doc page
for details.  SPPARKS now prints out its per-processor memory
footprint to assist in estimating how many MPI tasks you
need to run a large problem.

[11 Dec 2015]

Eric Homer (BYU) and Veena Tikare (Sandia) have written and added a
new hybrid Cahn-Hilliard phase-field plus Potts model as a new
"app_style potts/pfm"_doc/app_potts_pfm.html command for SPPARKS.  It
can be used to efficiently simulate grain growth in a two-phase system
controlled by diffusion.

See the doc page for more details on how to use it in SPPARKS, and for
a citation to their paper which gives a fuller explanation.

There is also an examples/potts_pfm dir with an example script and the
the "Pictures web page"_http://spparks.sandia.gov/pictures.html now
has images of simulations performed with this command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.11Dec15 from the 21
Oct 2015 version.

:line

[21 Oct 2015]

Updates to the new "app_style potts/grad"_doc/app_potts_grad.html
command.  There is now a examples/potts_grad dir with 3 examples of
how to use the application.  Some pictures and movies are on the
"Pictures"_http://spparks.sandia.gov/pictures.html page of the web
site.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Oct15 from the 8
Jul 2015 version.

:line

[8 Jul 2015]

Added a new on-lattice application, called "app_style
potts/grad"_doc/app_potts_grad.html.  It is a Potts model which allows
specification of linear gradients of temperature or mobility along a
given direction, which affects grain growth.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.8Jul15 from the 18
Mar 2015 version.

:line

[18 Nov 2013]

Have now allowed SPPARKS to be released (only in certain cases, by
request) under the LPGL (GNU Lesser General Public License).  Some doc
pages and README and LICENSE files were amended to state this.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Nov13 from the 5
Nov 2013 version.

:line

[5 Nov 2013]

Made the initial random number seed used by each of the "solve
styles"_doc/solve_style.html depend on processor ID, so that each
solver generates a different random stream.  For many models this
isn't needed, but if you start a simulation with a homogeneous lattice
on every proc, you need more randomness to avoid correlations between
processors.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Nov13 from the 7
Mar 2013 version.

:line

[7 Mar 2013]

Added a Python wrapper to SPPARKS, along with documentation for how to
build SPPARKS as a shared library, how to use the library interface,
and how to couple SPPARKS to other codes.  See new additions to the
manual in these sections:

"Section start"_doc/Section_start.html
"Section howto"_doc/Section_howto.html
"Section python"_doc/Section_python.html :ul

Also see these new directories in the distro:

python
examples/COUPLE :ul

The python dir has examples of Python scripts that invoke SPPARKS.
The COUPLE dir has an example of a coupled
SPPARKS/"LAMMPS"_http::lammps.sandia.gov application using kinetic
Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics.  It also includes a small library
that does communication of data back-and-forth between the 2 codes.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Mar13 from the 4

Eric Homer (BYU) fixed a memory bug with the "undump"_doc/undump.html
command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.4Jun12 from the 19

[19 May 2012]

Xiaowang Zhou (Sandia) ran into a bug with the
"create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html command when it was calculating
lattice connectivity with periodic lattices defined for simulation
boxes that were specified at arbitrary positions (not at the origin).
Due to a round-off issue, site-to-site connectitivy was sometimes
mixed up.  This patch should fix the problem.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19May12 from the 18
May 2012 version.

[18 May 2012]

Greg Ho (Lockheed Martin) identified a bug when lattice sites
(positions and neighbors) are read in thru a
"read_sites"_doc/read_sites.html command, as opposed to being
intialized thru a "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html command and
just having their values setup via a read_sites file.  I believe this
bug was introduced by some of the changes to SPPARKS last fall.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18May12 from the 17
May 2012 version.

[17 May 2012]

Seyed Mehdi Vaez Allaei and Morteza Jalalvand (U Tehran) found and

[16 May 2012]

Craig Jolley flagged a bug with the "solve_style
linear"_doc/solve_style.html command, that can occasionally occur due
to round-off when adding up a long list of probabilities.  This patch
should fix it.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16May12 from the 20
Jan 2012 version.

[20 Jan 2012]

Changed the Makefile to use a Make.sh script for finding style files
instead of a Make.csh script.  Csh is no longer included in some Linux
distribution, but "sh" always is.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.20Jan12 from the 10
Jan 2012 version.

:line

[10 Jan 2012]

Eric Homer (BYU) suggested a change in the dump image command so that
it will be consistent with other views when viewed from theta = 0 of
180, which is nominally a degenerate view angle.  This patch attempts
to remedy that.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.10Jan12 from the 6
Jan 2012 version.

:line

[6 Jan 2012]

Fixed a glitch in the 4Jan12 patch and added a missing file

Eric Homer (BYU) found and fixed a bug in the "set site
range"_doc/set.html command where the range of integer values was off
by 2 when using a lower bound.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.4Jan12 from the 3
Jan 2012 version.

:line

[3 Jan 2012]

Changed the format of error messages generated by SPPARKS to include
the source file and line #, which can be useful in debugging.  Also
included the explanation of the error messages in the header files of
each class, to make the code more self-documenting.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.3Jan12 from the 23
Dec 2011 version.

:line

[23 Dec 2011]

Made some upgrades to the dump image command to make it more
compatible with other versions of the code base for this class.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Dec11 from the 27
Oct 2011 version.

:line

[27 Oct 2011]

Made the length of the output string for statistics to be an
easily-changed setting in the src/output.cpp.  The default length is
now 4096 characters, which ought to be long enough for most
simulations.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27Oct11 from the 24
Oct 2011 version.

:line

[24 Oct 2011]

Fixed a bug in the new "boundary"_doc/boundary.html command which had
to do with hou neighbor sites were identified for on-lattice
applications when using lattices with multi-site basis sets.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Oct11 from the 23
Sep 2011 version.

Thanks to Antonio Gomez for finding and fixing the issue.

:line

[23 Sep 2011]

Added a "boundary" option to the "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html
command.  This allows boundaries to be drawn between adjacent sites
if their specified values are different.  It is useful for
visualizing the boundaries between aggregated groups of sites
when the colors of sites in the adjacent groups are the same.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Sep11 from the 22
Sep 2011 version.

[22 Sep 2011]

There were still some glitches in the 20Sep11 patch
with respect to non-periodic systems.  Hopefully this
patch fixes the remaining issues.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Sep11 from the 20
Sep 2011 version.

:line

[20 Sep 2011]

Added a "boundary"_doc/boundary.html command to allow specification of
non-periodic boundaries in an on-lattice application.  This affects
the way sites are created and eliminates site neighbors across
non-periodic boundaries.  See the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
and "read_sites"_doc/read_sites.html commands for more details.  Using
"create_sites region"_doc/create_sites.html is now supported to only
create sites within a geometric region.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.20Sep11 from the 2
Sep 2011 version.

:line

[2 Sep 2011]

Fixed an indexing bug in the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
command.

Updated the input scripts in the examples to reflect the new syntax
for the "dump"_doc/dump.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.2Sep11 from the 29
Jul 2011 version.

[29 Jul 2011]

Upgraded the dummy MPI library (used with make serial) to
be compatible with the 64-bit options now available in SPPARKS.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.29Jul11 from the 25
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[25 Jul 2011]

Added a sweep counter back to the output stats for sectored
KMC solves.  Somehow this got lost from an earlier version.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.25Jul11 from the 18
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[18 Jul 2011]

Enhanced SPPARKS to be able to run arbitraryily large models with more
than 2 billions sites, limited only by the physical memory on your
machine.  This requires use of 64-bit integers to store site IDs and
various system tallies, like the number of accepted and rejected
events.

The data types for this are now defined in the file src/spktype.h,
which by default is set to allow for large problems.  To reduce memory
usage or for machines or MPI implementations that do not support
64-bit integers, you can revert to 32-bit integers by editing that
file.  See "this section of the manual"_doc/Section_start.html for
more details.

There is still a limit of around 2 billions sites per processor, which
should not be a restriction since that would have a huge memory
footprint to store neibhbor lists.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Jul11 from the 16
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[16 Jul 2011]

More upgrades to the "dump_image"_doc/dump_image.html command,
including an option to generate a list of random colors via the
"dump_modify scolor"_doc/dump_modify.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Jul11 from the 15
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[15 Jul 2011]

Fixed a glitch in the color table map for the "dump
image"_doc/dump_image.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Jul11 from the 14
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[14 Jul 2011]

With considerable help from graphics whiz Nathan Fabian (Sandia), we
added a "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html command with accompanying
options settable via the "dump_modify"_doc/dump_modify.html command.

This enables you to write out a series of high-quality, ray-traced JPG
or PPM images of the collection of sites from lattice-based
applications.  Of course, this does not replace the need for a
full-featured, interactive post-processing visulization capability,
but it does provide a simple, easy way to quickly see how your
simulation is working, since there are numerous tools that can display
individual image files or animate a series of them.  It is also
convenient for very large models, as a replacement for large dump
snapshots.

The "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html doc page includes a couple sample
images you can view.

As part of this command, the previous "dump"_doc/dump.html command now
requires a "style" argument, which can be either "text" or "image".
The previous dump command is now the "text" style.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Jul11 from the 7
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[7 Jul 2011]

Fixed some problems with the "group-style
solver"_doc/solve_style.html.  This includes one accuracy bug with the
way changed propensities were assigned to new groups, and some
bookkeeping changes for how zero-valued propensities were handled.
The specified {lo} and {hi} bounds can now be exact matches to event
propensities of your model.  A warning message is printed if generated
propensities violate the specified bounds.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Jul11 from the 5
Jul 2011 version.

[5 Jul 2011]

Fix a logic error with communication when performing multiple
runs with changing sector rules.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Jul11 from the 24
Jun 2011 version.

[24 Jun 2011]

Made some lo-level changes within the lattice app base class
to support a new phase field app we'll release later.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Jun11 from the 15

diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html application, that would prevent
deposition if the site at the origin ever became unoccupied.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27May11 from the 30
Mar 2011 version.

[30 Mar 2011]

Added some additional hooks in the AppLattice class that a user
application can use to add custom functionality.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.30Mar11 from the 21
Mar 2011 version.

:line

[21 Mar 2011]

Enabled the region option on the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
command, so that sites can be created within a geometric region.

Also converted some counters to 64-bit integers to avoid overflow.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Mar11 from the 16
Sept 2010 version.

:line

[16 Sept 2010]

Added an "app_style potts/strain"_doc/app_potts_strain.html
application to model grain growth in the presence of a strain value at
each lattice site.  If SPPARKS is used as a library, then the strain
values can be updated dynamically by another application, such as
"LAMMPS"_lammps, via a driver code.  The LAMMPS distribution includes
an example coupling program that does this, in its "couple" directory.

Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the "app_style
diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.
