SPPARKS is a parallel Monte Carlo code for on-lattice and off-lattice
models that includes algorithms for kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC),
rejection kinetic Monte Carlo (rKMC), and Metropolis Monte Carlo
(MMC).  It implements several KMC solvers whose serial computational
complexity ranges from O(N) to O(NlogN) to O(1) in the number of
events N owned by a processor.  In a generic sense the solvers catalog
a list of "events", each with an associated probability, choose a
single event to perform, and advance time by the correct amount.
Events may be chosen individually at random, or by sweeping over sites
in a more ordered fashion.

Applications that are packaged with SPPARKS, or which a user adds to
the code, define sites and events and probabilities, as well as how
the execution of an event changes the state of the model.

SPPARKS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing
techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain.  The
code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
functionality.

SPPARKS Highlight :c,h4

(see the "Pictures & Movies"_pictures.html page for more examples of
SPPARKS calculations) :c

This is work by Liz Holm (eaholm at sandia.gov) at Sandia and Todd
Hoffmann (todd.hoffmann at asu.edu) and his advisor at Carnegie
Mellon, to study the mechanisms and statistics associated with
abnormal grain growth. In grain growth, when the system is annealed,
grain boundaries will move and rearrange so as to increase the average
grain size and decrease the grain boundary area per unit volume. In
normal grain growth, this occurs relatively uniformly, but in abnormal
grain growth, one grain grows at the expense of the others. Abnormal
grain growth can have many causes. Here the effects of static particle
dispersions on grain growth are studied. Particles should pin grain
boundaries in positions that maximize their contact with the
particles, so that grain growth cannot proceed. However, occasionally
one grain breaks free and is able to grow at the expense of others,
leading to abnormal growth.

The images and movies show typical results for a 300x300x300 lattice,
run for a million Monte Carlo steps (sweep over all lattice istes),
with 5 volume percent pinning particles, inserted when the average
grain radius was 10 sites.  In the normal case, the system becomes
fully pinned.  In the second case, abnormal growth eventually occurs.
