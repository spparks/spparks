Additive manufacturing (AM) is of tremendous interest given its
ability to realize complex, nontraditional geometries in engineered
structural materials. However, microstructures generated from AM
processes can be equally, if not more, complex than their
conventionally processed counterparts.  While some microstructural
features observed in AM may also occur in more traditional
solidification processes, the introduction of spatially and temporally
mobile heat sources can result in significant microstructural
heterogeneity. While grain size and shape in metal AM structures are
understood to be highly dependent on both local and global temperature
profiles, the exact form of this relation is not well
understood. Here, an idealized molten zone and temperature-dependent
grain boundary mobility are implemented in a kinetic Monte Carlo model
to predict three-dimensional grain structure in additively
manufactured metals. To demonstrate the flexibility of the model,
synthetic microstructures are generated under conditions mimicking
relatively diverse experimental results present in the literature.
Simulated microstructures are then qualitatively and quantitatively
compared to their experimental complements and are shown to be in good
agreement.
