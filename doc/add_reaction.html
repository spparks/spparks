<H3>add_reaction command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>add_reaction reactant1 reactant2 rate product1 product2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>reactant1,reactant2 = 0, 1, or 2 reactant species
<LI>rate = reaction rate (see units below)
<LI>product1, product2 = 0, 1, or more product species 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>add_reaction A B 1.0e10 C
add_reaction 1.0 d
add_reaction b2 1.0e-10 c3 d4 e3 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines a chemical reaction for use in the <A HREF = "app_chemistry.html">app_style
chemistry</A> application.
</P>
<P>Each reaction has 0, 1, or 2 reactants.  It also has 0, 1, or more
products.  The reactants and products are specified by species ID
strings, as defined by the <A HREF = "add_species.html">add_species</A> command.
</P>
<P>The units of the specified rate constant depend on how many reactants
participate in the reaction:
</P>
<UL><LI>0 reactants = rate is molarity/sec
<LI>1 reactant = rate is 1/sec
<LI>2 reactants = rate is 1/molarity-sec 
</UL>
<P>Thus the first reaction listed above represents an A and B molecule
binding to form a complex C at a rate of 1.0e10 per molarity per
second.  I.e. A + B -> C.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

<P>This command can only be used as part of the <A HREF = "app_chemistry.html">app_style
chemistry</A> application.
