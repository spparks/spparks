</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Modify the parameters of a previously defined dump command.  Not all
parameters are relevant to both the <I>text</I> and <I>image</I> dump styles.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>backcolor</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It
sets the background color of the images.  The color name can be any of
the 140 pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>boundcolor</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It
sets the color used to draw boundaries between sites, each of which is
a set of 4 cylinders, as described in the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
doc page.  The color name can be any of the 140 pre-defined colors
(see below) or a color name defined by the dump_modify color option.
</P>
<P>The drawing of boundaries between neighboring sites is enabled by the
<I>boundary</I> keyword of the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>boxcolor</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It
sets the color of the simulation box drawn around the sites in each
image.  See the "dump image box" command for how to specify that a box
be drawn.  The color name can be any of the 140 pre-defined colors
(see below) or a color name defined by the dump_modify color option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>color</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It allows
definition of a new color name, in addition to the 140-predefined
colors (see below), and associates 3 red/green/blue RGB values with
that color name.  The color name can then be used with any other
dump_modify keyword that takes a color name as a value.  The RGB
values should each be floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0
inclusive.
</P>
<P>When a color name is converted to RGB values, the user-defined color
names are searched first, then the 140 pre-defined color names.  This
means you can also use the <I>color</I> keyword to overwrite one of the
pre-defined color names with new RBG values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>delay</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>delta</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>flush</I> option determines whether a flush operation in invoked
after a dump snapshot is written to the dump file.  A flush insures
the output in that file is current (no buffering by the OS), even if
SPPARKS halts before the simulation completes.  The <I>flush</I> option is
only relevant to the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump text</A> style.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>logfreq</I> and <I>loglinfreq</I> keywords will produce output at progressively
larger intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be <I>N</I>
outputs per interval where the size of each interval is initially
<I>delta</I> and then scales up by <I>factor</I> each time. See the <A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A>
command for more information on how the output times are specified.
</P>
<P>If <I>N</I> is specified as 0, then this will turn off logarithmic output,
and revert to regular output every <I>delta</I> seconds.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>pad</I> keyword only applies when the dump filename is specified
with a wildcard "*" character which becomes the timestep.  If <I>pad</I> is
0, which is the default, the timestep is converted into a string of
unpadded length, e.g. 100 or 12000 or 2000000.  When <I>pad</I> is
specified with <I>Nchar</I> > 0, the string is padded with leading zeroes
so they are all the same length = <I>Nchar</I>.  For example, pad 7 would
yield 0000100, 0012000, 2000000.  This can be useful so that
post-processing programs can easily read the files in ascending
timestep order.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>region</I> keyword allows sub-selection of lattice sites to output.
If specified, only sites in the region will be written to the dump
file or included in the image.  Only one region can be applied as a
filter (the last one specified).  See the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command
for more details.  Note that a region can be defined as the "inside"
or "outside" of a geometric shape, and it can be the "union" or
"intersection" of a series of simpler regions.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>scolor</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It can
be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command, when its site
color setting is an integer attribute, and a <I>crange</I> setting from
<I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I> has been specified to set the color associated with each
integer value.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>I</I> value should be an integer from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>
inclusive.  A wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in
conjunction with the <I>type</I> argument to specify a range of values.
This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  An asterisk with no
numeric values means all values from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>.  A leading asterisk
means all values from <I>lo</I> to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk
means all values from n to <I>hi</I> (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means
all values from m to n (inclusive).
</P>
<P>The specified <I>color</I> can be a single color which is any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.  Or it can be two or more colors separated
by a "/" character, e.g. red/green/blue.  In the former case, that
color is assigned to all the specified integer values.  In the latter
case, the list of colors are assigned in a round-robin fashion to each
of the specified integer values.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>color</I> can also be the word <I>random</I>.  In this case,
random red/blue/green color values, each from 0.0 to 1.0, are
generated for each <I>I</I> value.  This is a convenient way to assign a
large number of random colors, without having to list them explicitly
by name.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>sdiam</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It can be
used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command, when its site
diameter setting is an integer attribute, and a <I>drange</I> setting from
<I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I> has been specified to set the diameter associated with
each integer value.  The specified <I>I</I> value should be an integer from
<I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>.  As with the <I>scolor</I> keyword, a wildcard asterisk can
be used as part of the <I>I</I> argument to specify a range of values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>smap</I> keyword applies only to the dump <I>image</I> style.  It can be
used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command, when its site
color setting is a floating point attribute, to setup a color map.
The color map is used to assign a specific RGB (red/green/blue) color
value to an individual site when it is drawn, based on the atom's
attribute, which is a numeric value, e.g. its x coordinate, if the
attribute "x" was specified.
</P>
<P>The basic idea of a color map is that the site-attribute will be
within a range of values, and that range is associated with a series
of colors (e.g. red, blue, green).  An sites's specific value (x =
-3.2) can then mapped to the series of colors (e.g. halfway between
red and blue), and a specific color is determined via an interpolation
procedure.
</P>
<P>There are many possible options for the color map, enabled by the
<I>smap</I> keyword.  Here are the details.
</P>
<P>The <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> settings determine the range of values allowed for
the site attribute.  If numeric values are used for <I>lo</I> and/or <I>hi</I>,
then values that are lower/higher than lo/hi are set to either <I>lo</I> or
<I>hi</I>.  I.e. the range is static.  If <I>lo</I> is specified as <I>min</I> or
<I>hi</I> as <I>max</I> then the range is dynamic, and the lower and/or upper
bound will be calculated each time an image is drawn, based on the set
of sites being visualized.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> setting is two letters, such as "ca".  The first letter is
either "c" for continuous, "d" for discrete, or "s" for sequential.
The second letter is either "a" for absolute, or "f" for fractional.
</P>
<P>A continuous color map is one in which the color changes continuously
from value to value within the range.  A discrete color map is one in
which discrete colors are assigned to sub-ranges of values within the
range.  A sequential color map is one in which discrete colors are
assigned to a sequence of sub-ranges of values covering the entire
range.
</P>
<P>An absolute color map is one in which the values to which colors are
assigned are specified explicitly as values within the range.  A
fractional color map is one in which the values to which colors are
assigned are specified as a fractional portion of the range.  For
example if the range is from -10.0 to 10.0, and the color red is to be
assigned to atoms with a value of 5.0, then for an absolute color map
the number 5.0 would be used.  But for a fractional map, the number
0.75 would be used since 5.0 is 3/4 of the way from -10.0 to 10.0.
</P>
<P>The <I>delta</I> setting is only specified if the style is sequential.  It
specifies the bin size to use within the range for assigning
consecutive colors to.  For example, if the range is from -10.0 to
10.0 and a <I>delta</I> of 1.0 is used, then 20 colors will be assigned to
the range.  The first will be from -10.0 <= color1 < -9.0, then 2nd
from -9.0 <= color2 < -8.0, etc.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> setting is how many entries follow.  The format of the entries
depends on whether the color map style is continuous, discrete or
sequential.  In all cases the <I>color</I> setting can be any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.
</P>
<P>For continuous color maps, each entry has a <I>value</I> and a <I>color</I>.
The <I>value</I> is either a number within the range of values or <I>min</I> or
<I>max</I>.  The <I>value</I> of the first entry must be <I>min</I> and the <I>value</I>
of the last entry must be <I>max</I>.  Any entries in between must have
increasing values.  Note that numeric values can be specified either
as absolute numbers or as fractions (0.0 to 1.0) of the range,
depending on the "a" or "f" in the style setting for the color map.
</P>
<P>Here is how the entries are used to determine the color of an
individual site, given the value X of its site attribute.  X will fall
between 2 of the entry values.  The color of the site is linearly
interpolated (in each of the RGB values) between the 2 colors
associated with those entries.  For example, if X = -5.0 and the 2
surrounding entries are "red" at -10.0 and "blue" at 0.0, then the
site's color will be halfway between "red" and "blue", which happens
to be "purple".
</P>
<P>For discrete color maps, each entry has a <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> value and a
<I>color</I>.  The <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> settings are either numbers within the
range of values or <I>lo</I> can be <I>min</I> or <I>hi</I> can be <I>max</I>.  The <I>lo</I>
and <I>hi</I> settings of the last entry must be <I>min</I> and <I>max</I>.  Other
entries can have any <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> values and the sub-ranges of
different values can overlap.  Note that numeric <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> values
can be specified either as absolute numbers or as fractions (0.0 to
1.0) of the range, depending on the "a" or "f" in the style setting
for the color map.
</P>
<P>Here is how the entries are used to determine the color of an
individual site, given the value X of its site attribute.  The entries
are scanned from first to last.  The first time that <I>lo</I> <= X <=
<I>hi</I>, X is assigned the color associated with that entry.  You can
think of the last entry as assigning a default color (since it will
always be matched by X), and the earlier entries as colors that
override the default.  Also note that no interpolation of a color RGB
is done.  All sites will be drawn with one of the colors in the list
of entries.
</P>
<P>For sequential color maps, each entry has only a <I>color</I>.  Here is how
the entries are used to determine the color of an individual site,
given the value X of its site attribute.  The range is partitioned
into N bins of width <I>binsize</I>.  Thus X will fall in a specific bin
from 1 to N, say the Mth bin.  If it falls on a boundary between 2
bins, it is considered to be in the higher of the 2 bins.  Each bin is
assigned a color from the E entries.  If E < N, then the colors are
repeated.  For example if 2 entries with colors red and green are
specified, then the odd numbered bins will be red and the even bins
green.  The color of the site is the color of its bin.  Note that the
sequential color map is really a shorthand way of defining a discrete
color map without having to specify where all the bin boundaries are.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>thresh</I> keyword allows sub-selection of lattice sites to output.
Multiple thresholds can be specified.  Specifying "none" turns off all
threshold criteria.  If thresholds are specified, only sites whose
attributes meet all the threshold criteria are written to the dump
file or included in the image.  The possible attributes that can be
tested for are the same as the fields that can be specified in the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command.  Note that different attributes can be
output by the dump command than are used as threshold criteria by the
dump_modify command.  E.g. you can output the coordinates and
propensity of sites whose energy is above some threshold.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

applications.  See the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for further
