<H3>deposition command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>deposition mode rate dirx diry dirz d0 lo hi 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>mode = off or event or batch
<LI>rate = rate of atom deposition (atom/sec units)
<LI>dirx,diry,dirz = vector in direction of incidence
<LI>d0 = capture distance (distance units)
<LI>lo,hi = min/max coordination number of deposition site 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>deposition	 event 1.0 0 -1 0 1.0 1 4 
deposition	 batch 1.0 1 1 -1 1.0 3 10
deposition       off 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command invokes deposition events in an on-lattice diffusion
model, specified by the <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style diffusion</A>
command.
</P>
<P>If *mode* is set to *off*, then no additional arguments are used.
Deposition is turned off.  This can be useful when deposition
previously took place, but is now turned off.
</P>
<P>If *mode* is set to *event*, then deposition events will be performed
in tandem with diffusive hop events in the KMC diffusion model.  This
option only works when running on a single processor.
</P>
<P>If *mode* is set to *batch*, then deposition events will be performed
as a batch at the end of each KMC loop over sectors.  Thus diffusive
events and deposition events are separated.  This option only works
when running in parallel on multiple processors.
</P>
<P>For each trial deposition, a random starting point at the top of the
simulation box is selected (top y surface in 2d, top z surface in 3d).
The atom trajectory (straight line) is traced along its incident
direction which is specified by (dirx,diry,dirz) and need not be a
unit vector.  However, diry < 0 and dirz = 0 is required for 2d
models.  Similarly, dirz < 0 is required for 3d models.
</P>
<P>Candidate deposition sites are vacant sites within a perpendicular
distance <I>d0</I> from the incident trajectory which also have a current
coordination number C such that <I>lo</I> <= C <= <I>hi</I>.  Note that <I>d0</I> is
specified in distance units which will depend on how the lattice of
sites is defined via the <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command.  For example,
if the lattice constant or box size in specified in Angstroms, then
the distance units for this command are Angstroms as well.
</P>
<P>If the inicident angle is not vertical, then periodic images of the
starting point with associated incident trajectories are considered
and the <I>d0</I> capture distance is applied to whichever trajectory the
candidate site is closest to, in a perpendicular sense.  This means
x-periodicity in 2d and x- and y-periodicity in 3d.
</P>
<P>For the set of candidate sites, the selected deposition site is the
one closest to the starting point, measuring the distance from the
projected perpendicular point to the starting point.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">App_style diffusion</A> defines valid
sites as vacant (site value = 1) or occupied (value = 2).  When
performing deposition, a row (2d) or plane (3d) of sites at the top of
the system (where the deposited atoms are incident from) should be set
to a value of 3.  This prevents those sites from being considered as
candidate deposition sites, due to them being neighbors of occupied
sites at the bottom of the system in a periodic sense.
