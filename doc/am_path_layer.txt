am path_layer command :h3

[Syntax:]

am path_layer layer_id num_paths N path_ids (tuple paths_ids) thickness t :pre

layer_id = integer identification number for this path_layer
num_paths = required keyword
N = integer number of paths specified on this layer
path_ids = required keyword
(tuple path_ids) = tuple array of path_ids corresponding {am path} specifications elsewhere in script
thickness = required keyword
t = thickness in sites of layer :ul

[Examples]

variable X0 equal         0.0
variable Y0 equal         0.0
variable X1 equal        500.0
variable Y1 equal        500.0
variable X2 equal        106.1
variable Y2 equal         0.0
variable X3 equal        500.0
variable Y3 equal        393.9
am path 1 start ${X0} ${Y0} end ${X1} ${Y1} speed 9
am path 2 start ${X3} ${Y3} end ${X2} ${Y2} speed 9
am path_layer 1 num_paths 2 path_ids 1 2 thickness 1 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used by "am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html, and
"potts/am/weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html applications to specify raster
patterns on path build layers.  Multiple path_layers can be defined in
a single input file, using unique id values.  Although simple build
simulations can be conducted using this command by manually writing
scripts that use {am path_layer}, it is expected that this command
will generally be automatically created for the purpose of handling
more complex geometries.

The {num_paths} and {path_ids} keywords are used to create the layer
with {thickness t}.  The build layer {thickness} is specified in units
of sites.

In example above, two unique {am path}s are created; these paths are
referenced in the {am path_layer} command.  This example is also
illustrated for "am_path"_am_path.html,

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of apps
"am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html or
"potts/am/weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html applications.

[Default:] none
