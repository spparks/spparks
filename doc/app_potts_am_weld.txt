app_style potts/am/weld command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style nspins alpha beta haz

style = potts/am/weld :l
nspins = number of possible Potts model spins :l
alpha = controls relative size of melt pool shape at bottom compared to top :l
beta = Bezier control point parameter that defines curvature of melt pool shape through thickness  :l
haz = width of the heat affected zone (haz) surrounding the melt pool :l
:ule

[Examples:]

app_style potts/am/weld 10000 0.5 0.75 50.0
weld_shape_ellipse 100.0 150.0 :pre

The {app_style potts/am/weld} command uses a subset of the command parameters
used by {app_style potts/weld} -- additional explanation provided below.  For
an explanation of the above commands and parameters, see
"potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html example.  This application requires melt pool
geometry commands -- per example above and explanation below.

This application requires rastering commands -- per explanation given below.

The "pulse"_pulse.html command is disabled in this application.

[Description:]

This is an application for 2D additive manufacturing simulations and is an
adaptation of "potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html; it can be viewed as a
"potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html model with rastering commands as defined and
used by "potts_additive"_app_potts_additive.html. The 2D limitation of this app
derives from the full penetration weld assumption; {potts/weld}; does not have
a melt pool bottom that naturally occurs in an additive manufacturing build the
{z}-direction.  Thickness of the lattice in the z-direction is taken as the
plate thickness per description in the "potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html; such
simulations will produce meaningful 3D microstructures.  However, it is
generally more efficient to run 2D calculations with this app using only one
plane of lattice sites.

Application {potts/am/weld} command values are all associated with
"potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html and have identical
interpretations/meanings for {potts/am/weld}.  Some values, e.g.
{yp,velocity},  used in {potts/weld}, have been moved to raster commands.

The following commands must be used to specify pool geometry:

"weld_shape_ellipse"_weld_shape_ellipse.html: specify elliptical pool shape parameters
"weld_shape_teardrop"_weld_shape_teardrop.html: specify teardrop pool shape parameters :tb(s=:)

The following additional commands are typically used by this application.
A layer must be defined: one of "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html 
or "am path_layer"_am_path_layer.html.  A layer requires 1 to many "am path"_am_path.html
or at least 1 "am pass"_am_pass.html.  Since this application only runs 1 layer, 
the {am build} command described below is optional.

"am pass"_am_pass.html: Specify pass parameters 
used to construct {cartesian_layer}. 

"am path"_am_path.html: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points on 
a layer; sequence of {am path}s are used to construct an 
"am path_layer"_am_path_layer.html.

"am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from {am pass} and other parameters. 

"am build"_am_build.html: May be used to combinations of layers that comprise a pattern.

{NOTE}: Because {potts/am/weld} is intended for {2D} simulations, only the
first layer, as specified in the {am build} command, is used; this application
does not simulate multilayer builds.  The examples/potts_additive directory
has input files which illustrate how to use the rastering commands.  

The "temperature"_temperature.html command should be used to set simulation Monte Carlo temperature.

[Restrictions:]

This application is only compatible with square and square cubic
lattices.  It can only be evolved by a rejection KMC (rKMC) algorithm.
See "sweep"_sweep.html for more information.
