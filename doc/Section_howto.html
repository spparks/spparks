<H3>4. How-to discussions 
</H3>
<P>The following sections describe how to perform various operations in
SPPARKS.
</P>
4.1 <A HREF = "#howto_1">Running multiple simulations from one input script</A><BR>
4.2 <A HREF = "#howto_2">Coupling SPPARKS to other codes</A><BR>
4.3 <A HREF = "#howto_3">Library interface to SPPARKS</A> <BR>

<P>The example input scripts included in the SPPARKS distribution and
highlighted in <A HREF = "Section_example.html">this section</A> also show how to
setup and run various kinds of problems.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "howto_1"></A><H4>4.1 Running multiple simulations from one input script 
</H4>
<P>This can be done in several ways.  See the documentation for
individual commands for more details on how these examples work.
</P>
<P>If "multiple simulations" means continue a previous simulation for
more timesteps, then you simply use the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command
multiple times.  For example, this script
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising/2d/4n 100 100 12345
...
run 1.0
run 1.0
run 1.0
run 1.0
run 1.0 
</PRE>
<P>would run 5 successive simulations of the same system for a total of
5.0 seconds of elapsed time.
</P>
<P>If you wish to run totally different simulations, one after the other,
the <A HREF = "clear.html">clear</A> command can be used in between them to
re-initialize SPPARKS.  For example, this script
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising/2d/4n 100 100 12345
...
run 1.0
clear
app_style ising/2d/4n 200 200 12345
...
run 1.0 
</PRE>
<P>would run 2 independent simulations, one after the other.
</P>
<P>For large numbers of independent simulations, you can use
<A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> and the <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> and
<A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> commands to loop over the same input script
multiple times with different settings.  For example, this
script, named in.runs
</P>
<PRE>variable d index run1 run2 run3 run4 run5 run6 run7 run8
shell cd $d
app_style ising/2d/4n 100 100 12345
include temperature.txt
run 1.0
shell cd ..
clear
next d
jump in.runs 
</PRE>
<P>would run 8 simulations in different directories, using a
temperature.txt file in each directory with an input command to set
the temperature.  The same concept could be used to run the same
system at 8 different sizes, using a size variable and storing the
output in different log files, for example
</P>
<PRE>variable a loop 8
variable size index 100 200 400 800 1600 3200 6400 10000
log log.${size}
app_style ising/2d/4n ${size} ${size} 12345
run 1.0
next size
next a
jump in.runs 
</PRE>
<P>All of the above examples work whether you are running on 1 or
multiple processors, but assumed you are running SPPARKS on a single
partition of processors.  SPPARKS can be run on multiple partitions
via the "-partition" command-line switch as described in <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this
section</A> of the manual.
</P>
<P>In the last 2 examples, if SPPARKS were run on 3 partitions, the same
scripts could be used if the "index" and "loop" variables were
replaced with <I>universe</I>-style variables, as described in the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command.  Also, the "next size" and "next a"
commands would need to be replaced with a single "next a size"
command.  With these modifications, the 8 simulations of each script
would run on the 3 partitions one after the other until all were
finished.  Initially, 3 simulations would be started simultaneously,
one on each partition.  When one finished, that partition would then
start the 4th simulation, and so forth, until all 8 were completed.

<A NAME = "howto_2"></A><H4>4.2 Coupling SPPARKS to other codes 
</H4>
<P>SPPARKS is designed to allow it to be coupled to other codes.  For
example, an atomistic code might relax atom positions and pass those
positions to SPPARKS.  Or a continuum finite element (FE) simulation
might use a Monte Carlo relaxation to formulate a boundary condition
on FE nodal points, compute a FE solution, and return the
results to the MC calculation.
</P>
<P>SPPARKS can be coupled to other codes in at least 3 ways.  Each has
advantages and disadvantages, which you'll have to think about in the
context of your application.
</P>
<P>(1) Define a new <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> command that calls the
other code.  In this scenario, SPPARKS is the driver code.  During its
timestepping, the diagnostic is invoked, and can make library calls to
the other code, which has been linked to SPPARKS as a library.  See
<A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> of the documentation for info on
how to add a new diagnostic to SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>(2) Define a new SPPARKS command that calls the other code.  This is
conceptually similar to method (1), but in this case SPPARKS and the
other code are on a more equal footing.  Note that now the other code
is not called during the even loop of a SPPARKS run, but between runs.
The SPPARKS input script can be used to alternate SPPARKS runs with
calls to the other code, invoked via the new command.
</P>
<P>In this scenario, the other code can be called as a library, as in
(1), or it could be a stand-alone code, invoked by a system() call
made by the command (assuming your parallel machine allows one or more
processors to start up another program).  In the latter case the
stand-alone code could communicate with SPPARKS thru files that the
command writes and reads.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> of the documentation for how to
add a new command to SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>(3) Use SPPARKS as a library called by another code.  In this case the
other code is the driver and calls SPPARKS as needed.  Or a wrapper
code could link and call both SPPARKS and another code as libraries.
</P>
<P>Examples of driver codes that call SPPARKS as a library are included in
the examples/COUPLE directory of the SPPARKS distribution; see
examples/COUPLE/README for more details:
</P>
<UL><LI>simple: simple driver programs in C++ and C which invoke SPPARKS as a
library (NOTE: not yet available)  

<LI>lammps_spparks: coupling of SPPARKS and <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/lammps.html">LAMMPS</A>, to couple a
kinetic Monte Carlo model for grain growth using MD to calculate
strain induced across grain boundaries 
</UL>


<P><A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_5">This section</A> of the documentation
describes how to build SPPARKS as a library.  Once this is done, you
can interface with SPPARKS either via C++, C, Fortran, or Python (or
any other language that supports a vanilla C-like interface).  For
example, from C++ you could create one (or more) "instances" of
SPPARKS, pass it an input script to process, or execute individual
commands, all by invoking the correct class methods in SPPARKS.  From
C or Fortran you can make function calls to do the same things.  See
<A HREF = "Section_python.html">Section_python</A> of the manual for a description
of the Python wrapper provided with SPPARKS that operates through the
SPPARKS library interface.
</P>
<P>The files src/library.cpp and library.h contain the C-style interface
to SPPARKS.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_3">Section_howto 3</A> of the
manual for a description of the interface and how to extend it for
your needs.
</P>
<P>Note that the spparks_open() function that creates an instance of
SPPARKS takes an MPI communicator as an argument.  This means that
instance of SPPARKS will run on the set of processors in the
communicator.  Thus the calling code can run SPPARKS on all or a subset
of processors.  For example, a wrapper script might decide to
alternate between SPPARKS and another code, allowing them both to run
on all the processors.  Or it might allocate half the processors to
SPPARKS and half to the other code and run both codes simultaneously
before syncing them up periodically.  Or it might instantiate multiple
instances of SPPARKS to perform different calculations.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "howto_3"></A><H4>4.3 Library interface to SPPARKS 
</H4>
<P>As described in <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_4">Section_start 4</A>, SPPARKS
can be built as a library, so that it can be called by another code,
used in a <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_2">coupled manner</A> with other
codes, or driven through a <A HREF = "Section_python.html">Python interface</A>.
</P>
<P>All of these methodologies use a C-style interface to SPPARKS that is
provided in the files src/library.cpp and src/library.h.  The
functions therein have a C-style argument list, but contain C++ code
you could write yourself in a C++ application that was invoking
SPPARKS directly.  The C++ code in the functions illustrates how to
invoke internal SPPARKS operations.  Note that SPPARKS classes are
defined within a SPPARKS namespace (SPPARKS_NS) if you use them from
another C++ application.
</P>
<P>Library.cpp contains these 4 functions:
</P>
<PRE>void spparks_open(int, char **, MPI_Comm, void **);
void spparks_close(void *);
void spparks_file(void *, char *);
char *spparks_command(void *, char *); 
</PRE>
<P>The spparks_open() function is used to initialize SPPARKS, passing in
a list of strings as if they were <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">command-line
arguments</A> when SPPARKS is run in
stand-alone mode from the command line, and a MPI communicator for
SPPARKS to run under.  It returns a ptr to the SPPARKS object that is
created, and which is used in subsequent library calls.  The
spparks_open() function can be called multiple times, to create
multiple instances of SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>SPPARKS will run on the set of processors in the communicator.  This
means the calling code can run SPPARKS on all or a subset of
processors.  For example, a wrapper script might decide to alternate
between SPPARKS and another code, allowing them both to run on all the
processors.  Or it might allocate half the processors to SPPARKS and
half to the other code and run both codes simultaneously before
syncing them up periodically.  Or it might instantiate multiple
instances of SPPARKS to perform different calculations.
</P>
<P>The spparks_close() function is used to shut down an instance of SPPARKS
and free all its memory.
</P>
<P>The spparks_file() and spparks_command() functions are used to pass a
file or string to SPPARKS as if it were an input script or single
command in an input script.  Thus the calling code can read or
generate a series of SPPARKS commands one line at a time and pass it
thru the library interface to setup a problem and then run it,
interleaving the spparks_command() calls with other calls to extract
information from SPPARKS, perform its own operations, or call another
code's library.
</P>
<P>Other useful functions are also included in library.cpp.  For example:
</P>
<PRE>void *spparks_extract(void *, char *)
double *spparks_energy() 
</PRE>
<P>These can extract various global or per-site quantities from SPPARKS
so that a driver application can access the values or even reset them.
See the library.cpp file and its associated header file library.h for
details.
</P>
<P>The key idea of the library interface is that you can write any
functions you wish to define how your code talks to SPPARKS and add
them to src/library.cpp and src/library.h, as well as to the <A HREF = "Section_python.html">Python
interface</A>.  The routines you add can access or
change any SPPARKS data you wish.  The examples/COUPLE and python
directories have example C++ and C and Python codes which show how a
driver code can link to SPPARKS as a library, run SPPARKS on a subset
of processors, grab data from SPPARKS, change it, and put it back into
SPPARKS.
