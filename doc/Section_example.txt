5. Example problems :h3

The SPPARKS distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems.  Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own.  Most are small models that can be run quickly, requiring at most
a couple of minutes to run on a desktop machine.  Each problem has an
input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*).  Some 
examples produce a Stitch file and/or a dump file
(dump.*).  A few sample log file outputs on different
machines and different numbers of processors are included in the
directories to compare your answers to.  E.g. a log file like
log.potts.foo.P means it ran on P processors of machine "foo".

See "Additional Tools"_Section_tools.html for visualization of outputs.

These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:

groups: test of group-based KMC solver
ising: standard Ising model
membrane: membrane model of pore formation around protein inclusions
potts: multi-state Potts model for grain growth :tb(s=:)

Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:

cd examples/potts
cp ../../src/spk_linux .           # copy SPPARKS executable to this dir
spk_linux < in.potts               # run the problem :pre

Running the simulation produces the files {dump.potts} and
{log.spparks}.

If you add "dump image"_dump_image.html line(s) to the input script a
series of JPG images will be produced by the run.  These can be viewed
individually or turned into a movie or animated by tools like
ImageMagick or QuickTime or various Windows-based tools.  See the
"dump image"_dump_image.html doc page for more details.  E.g. this
Imagemagick command would create a GIF file suitable for viewing in a
browser. FIXME

% convert -loop 1 *.jpg foo.gif :pre

There is also a COUPLE directory with examples of how to use SPPARKS
as a library, either by itself or in tandem with another code or
library.  See the COUPLE/README file to get started.
