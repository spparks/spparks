5. Example problems :h3

The SPPARKS distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems. Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own. Each problem has an input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*). Some examples produce a Stitch file and/or a dump file
(dump.*).

See "Additional Tools"_Section_tools.html for visualization of outputs.

These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:

am_ellipsoid:     3d Potts model for additive manufacturing
am_path:          additive manufacturing applications with use of a path
chemistry:        simple A + B <-> C reaction model
erbium:           erbium reaction/diffusion model
groups:           test of tree and group KMC solvers on a reaction network
ising:            2d Ising model
thin_film_growth: 2d thin file growth with diffusion app
membrane:         2d membrane model of lipid, fluid, protein states
multiphase:       multiphase diffusion
phasefield_potts: 3d Potts with phase field model
potts:            3d Potts model
potts_grad:       3d Potts model with temperature gradient
potts_quaternion: 3d Potts model incorporating crystalline orientations
potts_weld:       3d Potts model for welding applications
potts_weld_jom:   second 3d Potts model for welding applications
relax:            2d Metropolis atomic relaxation
sintering:        sintering application
stitch:           using the Stitch input/output options :tb(s=:)

Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:

cd examples/potts_quaternion
mpirun -np 8 ../../src/spk_mpi -in in.potts_cubic_2d # run the problem :pre

Running the simulation produces the files {potts_cubic_2d.st} and
{log.spparks}.

If you add "dump image"_dump_image.html line(s) to the input script a
series of JPG images will be produced by the run. 
For potts_quaternion in.potts_cubic_2d script the following line can be
added for example

% dump top image 1 potts_init.top.*.jpg site site view 0.0 0.0 crange 1 100000 drange 1 1 zoom 2.0 size 1024 1024 :pre

These can be viewed individually or turned into a movie or animated 
by tools like ImageMagick or QuickTime or various image editing tools. 
See the "dump image"_dump_image.html doc page for more details. The 

Imagemagick command to create a GIF file suitable for viewing in a 

browser would be (based on the above dump command):

% convert -loop 1 -delay 20 potts_init.top.*.jpg my_animation.gif :pre

For the potts_quaternion simulations per grain crystalline orientations are available enabling 
direct comparison with experimental EBSD datasets. Moreover SPPARKS crystalline orientations 

can be directly incorporated into existing EBSD post-processing and analysis packages like Orix/MTEX.
Additional analysis tools for stitch files are available in the spparks/tools directory.

There is also a COUPLE directory with examples of how to use SPPARKS
as a library, either by itself or in tandem with another code or
library.  See the COUPLE/README file to get started.
