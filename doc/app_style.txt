[Description:]

This command defines what model or application SPPARKS will run.
There are 3 kinds of applications: on-lattice, off-lattice, and
general.

On-lattice applications define a set of static sites in space on which
events occur.  The sites can represent a crystalline lattice, or be
more disordered.  The key point is that they are immobile and that
each site's neighborhood of nearby sites can be specified.  Here is
the list of on-lattice applications SPPARKS currently includes:

"diffusion"_app_diffusion.html = vacancy exchange diffusion model
"erbium"_app_erbium.html = H/He diffusion/rection on an Erbium lattice
"ising"_app_ising.html = Ising model
"ising/single"_app_ising.html = variant Ising model
"membrane"_app_membrane.html = membrane model of lipid,water,protein
"potts"_app_potts.html = Potts model for grain growth
"potts/neigh"_app_potts.html = variant Potts model
"potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html = variant Potts model
"potts/pin"_app_potts_pin.html = Potts model with pinning sites
"potts/strain"_app_potts_strain.html = Potts model with per-site strain :ul

Off-lattice applications define a set of mobile sites in space on
which events occur.  The sites typically represent particles.  Each
site's neighborhood of nearby sites is defined by a cutoff distance.
Here is the list of off-lattice applications SPPARKS currently
includes.

"relax"_app_relax.html = Metropolis Monte Carlo relaxation :ul

General applications require no spatial information.  Events are
defined by the application, as well as the influence of each event on
others.  Here is the list of general applications SPPARKS currently
includes.

"chemistry"_app_chemistry.html = biochemical reaction networks
"test/group"_app_test_group.html = artificial chemical networks that test "solve_style"_solve_style.html :ul

The general applications in SPPARKS can only be evolved via a kinetic
Monte Carlo (KMC) solver, specified by the
"solve_style"_solve_style.html command.  On-lattice and off-lattice
applications can be evolved by either a KMC solver or a rejection
kinetic Monte Carlo (rKMC) method or a Metropolis (MMC) method.  The
rKMC and MMC methods are specified by the "sweep"_sweep.html command.
Not all on- and off-lattice applications support each option.

KMC models are sometimes called rejection-free KMC or the N-fold way
or the Gillespie algorithm in the MC literature.  The application
defines a list of "events" and associated rates for each event.  The
solver chooses the next event, and the application updates the system
accordingly.  This includes updating of the time, which is done
accurately since rates are defined for each event.  For general
applications the definition of an "event" is arbitrary.  For
on-lattice application zero or more possible events are typically
defined for each site.

rKMC models are sometimes called null-event KMC or null-event MC.
Sites are chosen via some method (see the "sweep"_sweep.html command),
and an event on that site is then selected which is accepted or
rejected.  Again, the application defines the "events" for each site
and associated rates which influence the acceptance or rejection.  It
also defines the null event which is essentially part of the rejection
probability.

For KMC and rKMC models, a time is associated with each event
(including the null event) by rates that the user defines.  Thus event
selection induces a time-accurate simulation.  The MMC method is
similar to the rKMC method, except that it is not time-accurate.  It
selects an event to perform and accepts or rejects it, typically based
on an energy change in the system.  There is no rate associated with
the event, and no requirement that events be chosen with relative
probabilities corresponding to their rates.  The Metropolis method
tends to evolve the system towards a low energy state.  As with the
rKMC method, the "sweep"_sweep.html command is used to determine how
sites are selected.

For all three methods (KMC, rKMC, MMC) the rules for how events are
defined and are accepted or rejected are discussed in the doc pages
for the individual applications.

This table lists the different kinds of solvers and sweeping options
that can be used for on- and off-lattice applications in SPPARKS.
Serial and parallel refer to running on one or many processors.
Sector vs no-sector is what is set by the "sector"_sector.html
command.  The rKMC options are set by the "sweep"_sweep.html command.
The MMC options are the same as for rKMC.

method,	serial/no-sectors, serial/sectors, parallel/no-sectors, parallel/sectors
exact KMC, yes, yes, no, yes
rKMC random, yes, yes, no, yes
rKMC raster, yes, yes, no, yes
rKMC color, yes, yes, yes, yes
rKMC color/strict, yes, no, yes, no :tb(ea=c)

Note that masking can also be turned on for rKMC algorithms via the
"sweep"_sweep.html command if the application supports it.
Off-lattice applications do not support the {color} or {masking}
options.
