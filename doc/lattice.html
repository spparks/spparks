<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a lattice for use by other commands. In SPPARKS, a lattice is
simply a set of points in space, determined by a unit cell with basis
atoms, that is replicated infinitely in all dimensions. The arguments
of the lattice command can be used to define a wide variety of
crystallographic lattices.
</P>
<P>A lattice is used by SPPARKS in two ways. First, the
<A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command creates "sites" on the
lattice points inside the simulation box. Sites are used by an
on-lattice or off-lattice application, specified by the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command, which define events that change
the values associated with sites (e.g. a spin flip) or the coordinates
of the site itself (for off-lattice applications).
</P>
<P>Second, the lattice spacing in the x,y,z dimensions is
used by other commands such as the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command
to define distance units and define geometric extents, for
example in specifying the size of the simulation box via
the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
</P>
<P>The lattice style must be consistent with the dimension of the
simulation - see the <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A> command and
descriptions of each style below.
</P>
<P>A lattice consists of a unit cell, a set of basis sites within that
cell. The vectors a1,a2,a3 are the edge vectors of the unit cell. This
is the nomenclature for "primitive" vectors in solid-state
crystallography, but in SPPARKS the unit cell they determine does not
have to be a "primitive cell" of minimum volume.
</P>
<P>For on-lattice applications (see the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A>
command), the lattice definition also infers a connectivity between
lattice sites, which is used to generate the list of neighbors of each
site.  This information is ignored for off-lattice applications.  This
means that for a 2d off-lattice application, it makes no difference
whether a <I>sq/4n</I> or <I>sq/8n</I> lattice is used; they both simply
generate a square lattice of points.
</P>
<HR>

<P>In the style descriptions that follow, a = the lattice constant
defined by the lattice command.  Sites within a unit cell are defined
as (x,y,z) where 0.0 <= x,y,z < 1.0.
</P>
<P>A lattice of style <I>line/2n</I> is a 1d lattice with a1 = a 0 0 and one
basis site per unit cell at (0,0,0).  Each lattice point has 2
neighbors.
</P>
<P>Lattices of style <I>sq/4n</I> and <I>sq/8n</I> are 2d lattices with a1 = a 0 0
and a2 = 0 a 0, and one basis site per unit cell at (0,0,0).  The
<I>sq/4n</I> style has 4 neighbors per site (east/west/north/south); the
<I>sq/8n</I> style has 8 neighbors per site (same 4 as <I>sq/4n</I> plus 4
corner points).
</P>
<P>A lattice of style <I>tri</I> is a 2d lattice with a1 = a 0 0 and a2 = 0
sqrt(3)*a 0, and two basis sites per unit cell at (0,0,0) and
(0.5,0.5,0).  Each lattice points has 6 neighbors.
</P>
<P>Lattices of style <I>sc/6n</I> and <I>sc/26n</I> are 3d lattices with a1 = a 0 0
and a2 = 0 a 0 and a3 = 0 0 a, and one basis site per unit cell at
(0,0,0).  The <I>sc/6n</I> style has 6 neighbors per site
(east/west/north/south/up/down); the <I>sc/26n</I> style has 26 neighbors per
site (surrounding cube including edge and corner points).
</P>
<P>Lattices of style <I>bcc</I> and <I>fcc</I> and <I>diamond</I> are 3d lattice with a1
= a 0 0 and a2 = 0 a 0 and a3 = 0 0 a.  There are two basis sites per
unit cell for <I>bcc</I>, 4 basis sites for <I>fcc</I>, and 8 sites for
<I>diamond</I>.  The location of the basis sites are defined in any
solid-state physics or crystallography text.  The <I>bcc</I> style has 8
neighbors per site, the <I>fcc</I> has 12, and the <I>diamond</I> has 4.
</P>
<P>A lattice of style <I>fcc/octa/tetra</I> is a 3d lattice with a1 = a 0 0
and a2 = 0 a 0 and a3 = 0 0 a.  There are 16 basis sites per unit
cell, which consist of 4 fcc sites plus 4 octahedral and 8 tetrahedral
interstitial sites.  Again, these are defined in solid-state physics
texts.  There are 26 neighbors per fcc and octahedral site, and 14
neihbors per tetrahedral site.  More specifically, the neighbors
are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>neighbors of each fcc site: 12 fcc, 6 octa, 8 tetra
<LI>neighbors of each octa site: 6 fcc, 12 octa, 8 tetra
<LI>neighbors of each tetra site: 4 fcc, 4 octa, 6 tetra 
</UL>
<P>The <I>random</I> lattice styles are 1d, 2d, and 3d lattices with a1 = 1 0
0 and a2 = 0 1 0 and a3 = 0 0 1.  Note that no <I>scale</I> parameter is
defined and the unit cell is a unit cube, not a cube with side length
<I>a</I>.  Thus a <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command using one of these lattices
will define its geometric region directly, not as multiples of the
<I>scale</I> parameter.  When the <A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command
is used, it will generate a collection of Nrandom points within the
corresponding 1d, 2d, or 3d region or simulation box.  The number of
neighbors per site is defined by the specified <I>cutoff</I> parameter.
Two sites I,J will be neighbors of each other if they are closer than
the <I>cutoff</I> distance apart.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The command "lattice none" can be used to turn off a previous lattice
definition.  Any command that attempts to use the lattice directly
will then generate an error.  No additional arguments need be used
with "lattice none".
