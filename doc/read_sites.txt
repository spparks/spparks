read_sites command :h3

[Syntax:]

read_sites file :pre

file = name of data file to read in :ul

[Examples:]

read_sites data.potts
read_sites ../run7/data.potts.gz :pre

[Description:]

Read in a data file containing information SPPARKS needs to setup an
"on-lattice or off-lattice application"_app_style.html.  The file can
be ASCII text or a gzipped text file (detected by a .gz suffix).  This
is one of 2 ways to specify event sites; see the
"create_sites"_create_sites.html command for another method.

A data file has a header and a body, as described below.  The body of
the file contains up to 3 sections in the following order: Sites,
Neighbors, Values.  Sites defines the coordinates of event sites.
Neighbors define the neighbors of each site (only for on-lattice
applications).  Values assign per-site values to each site, which can
also be done via the "set"_set.html command.

The read_sites command can be used in one of 3 scenarios:

If a simulation box has not already been created and no event sites
exist, then the data file defines the box size (in the header), and it
must define Sites.  It must also define Neighbors for on-lattice
applications.  The Values section is optional, since these can be set
later via the "set"_set.html command.

If a simulation box has already been defined (by the "create_box"
command), but no sites have previously been defined, then the data
file must define Sites.  It must also define Neighbors for on-lattice
applications.  The Values section is optional.  If the data file
defines a box size, it must be consistent with the simulation box that
already exists.

If a simulation box has already been defined, and sites have previosly
been defined (by the "create_sites" command or a previous read_sites
command), then no Sites or Neighbors can be specfied, but the Values
section is used to set all or a subset of the per-site values defined
by the application.  This is a means of continuing a previous
simulation using a file written by the "dump sites"_dump.html command
as a restart file, since it writes in the format that this command
reads.

Note that the periodicity of the simulation box, as defined by the
"boundary"_boundary.html command is not considered by this command
when defining sites or neighbors.  It is up to you to insure sites are
not duplicated on a periodic boundary, or that a site's neighbor list
does not include sites that are on the other side of the simulation
box when the boundary is not periodic.  This is in contrast to the
"create_sites"_create_sites.html command which accounts for both of
these issues when defining sites and their neighbors.

:line

The first line of the header of the data file is always skipped; it
typically contains a description of the file.  Then lines are read one
at a time.  Lines can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that
is ignored.  If the line is blank (only whitespace after comment is
deleted), it is skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the
corresponding value(s) is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a
header keyword, the line begins the body of the file. 

The body of the file contains zero or more sections.  The first line
of a section has only a keyword.  The next line is skipped.  The
remaining lines of the section contain values.  The number of lines
depends on the section keyword as described below.  Zero or more blank
lines can be used between sections.  Sections can appear in any order,
with a few exceptions as noted below.

The formatting of individual lines in the data file (indentation,
spacing between words and numbers) is not important except that header
and section keywords (e.g. dimension, xlo xhi, Sites, Values) must be
capitalized as shown and can't have extra white space between their
words - e.g. two spaces or a tab between "xlo and "xhi" is not valid.

:line

These are the recognized header keywords.  Header lines can come in
any order.  The value(s) are read from the beginning of the line.
Thus the keyword {sites} should be in a line like "1000 sites"; the
keyword {ylo yhi} should be in a line like "-10.0 10.0 ylo yhi".  All
these numeric settings have a default value of 0, except the lo/hi box
size defaults which are -0.5 and 0.5.  A line need only appear if the
value is different than the default.  If the keyword values have
already been defined (e.g. box sizes for a previously created
simulation box), then the values in the data file must match.

{dimension} = dimension of system = 1,2,3
{sites} = number of sites
{max neighbors} = max # of neighbors of any site
{label1 label2 ... labelN values} = column labels for Values section
{xlo xhi} = simulation box boundaries in x dimension
{ylo yhi} = simulation box boundaries in y dimension
{zlo zhi} = simulation box boundaries in z dimension :ul

The {max neighbors} setting is only needed if the file contains a
Neighbors section, which is only used for on-lattice applications.

The {values} setting is only needed if a Values section is included in
the file, and if it does not list per-site info for all the integer
and floating point values defined by the application.  If only a
subset of per-site values are listed in each line, then the {values}
setting labels what they are.  The labels have the same syntax as
those defined by the "dump sites"_dump.html command, namely "id",
"site", "iN", or "dN".  Note that "id" must always be included and
come first, so that SPPARKS can assign the values that follow to the
correct site.

The simulation box size is determined by the lo/hi settings.  For 2d
simulations, the {zlo zhi} values should be set to bound the z coords
for atoms that appear in the file; the default of -0.5 0.5 is valid if
all z coords are 0.0.  The same rules hold for {ylo and yhi} for 1d
simulations.

:line

These are the possible section keywords for the body of the file:
{Sites, Neighbors, Values}.

Each section is listed below.  The format of each section is described
including the number of lines it must contain and rules (if any) for
where it can appear in the data file.

Any individual line in the various sections can have a trailing
comment starting with "#" for annotation purposes.  E.g. in the
Sites section:

10 10.0 5.0 6.0   # impuity site

:line

{Sites} section:

one line per site :ulb,l
line syntax: ID x y z :l
ID = global site ID (1-N)
x y z = coordinates of site :pre
example: :l
101 7.0 0.0 3.0 :pre
:ule

There must be N lines in this section where N = number of sites and is
defined by the {sites} keyword in the header section of the file.
The lines can appear in any order.

:line

{Neighbors} section:

one line per site :ulb,l
line syntax: ID n1 n2 n3 ... :l
ID = global site ID (1-N)
n1 n2 n3 ... = IDs of neighbor sites :pre
example: :l
101 7 32 15 1004 ... :pre
:ule

There must be N lines in this section where N = number of sites and is
defined by the {sites} keyword in the header section of the file.
The lines can appear in any order.

The number of neighbors can vary from site to site, but there can be
no more than {max neighbors} for any one site.  The neighbors of an
individual site can be listed in any order.

:line

{Values} section:

one line per site :ulb,l
line syntax: ID value1 value2 ... :l
ID = global site ID (1-N)
value1,value2,... = integer or floating point values for the site :pre
example: :l
101 1 3 4.0 :pre
:ule

There must be N lines in this section where N = number of sites and is
defined by the {sites} keyword in the header section of the file.
The lines can appear in any order.

The number of values per site depends on the {comment} keyword
in the header section of the file.  If it is not defined, then
the default line syntax is assumed to be:

line syntax: ID i1 i2 ... iN d1 d2 ... dN :l

meaning that all per-site values must be listed on each line.  In the
default case, they are listed in order, with the integer values first,
followed by the floating-point values.
