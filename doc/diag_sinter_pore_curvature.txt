diag_style sinter_pore_curvature command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style sinter_pore_curvature keyword value keyword value ... :pre

sinter_pore_curvature = style name of this diagnostic
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to a diagnostic command :ul

[Examples:]

diag_style sinter_pore_curvature :pre

[Description:]

The sinter pore curvature diagnostic computes the mean integral curvature of
the pores in the powder compact simulated. In addition the triple line length
is also computed. The calculation is done over the 1/27th central
parallelepiped in order to avoid border effects. The pore curvature and the
triple line length are printed as stats output via the "stats"_stats.html
command.

The method used to measure pore curvature is described in detail in "On
Sintering Stress in Complex Powder Compacts", Cristina G. Cardona, Veena Tikare,
Burton R. Patterson and Eugene Olevsky, J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 1-11 (2012)

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used for the sintering application.

[Default:] none
