diag_style sinter_pore_curvature command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style sinter_pore_curvature keyword value keyword value ... :pre

sinter_pore_curvature = style name of this diagnostic
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to a diagnostic command :ul

[Examples:]

diag_style sinter_pore_curvature :pre

[Description:]

The sinter pore curvature diagnostic computes the mean integral
curvature of the pores in the powder compact simulated. In addition
the triple line length is also computed. The calculation is done over
the 1/27th central parallelepiped in order to avoid border
effects. The pore curvature and the triple line length are printed as
stats output via the "stats"_stats.html command.

The method used to measure pore curvature is described in detail in
"On Sintering Stress in Complex Powder Compacts", Cristina G. Cardona,
Veena Tikare, Burton R. Patterson and Eugene Olevsky,
J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 1-11 (2012)

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used for the sintering application.

[Default:] none
