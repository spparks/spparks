<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>text</I>, <I>sites</I>, <I>vtk</I>, and <I>stitch</I> styles dump a snapshot of
site values to one or more files at time intervals of <I>delta</I> during a
simulation.  The <I>image</I> style creates a JPG or PPM image file of the
site configuration every at time intervals of <I>delta</I>, as discussed on
the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page.  The remainder of this page
describes the <I>text</I>, <I>sites</I>, <I>vtk</I>, and <I>stitch</I> styles.
</P>
<P>The <I>text</I> style dump file is in the format of a <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS dump
file</A> which can thus be read-in by the <A HREF = "https://lammps.github.io/pizza">Pizza.py
toolkit</A>, converted to other formats, or used for visualization.
</P>
<P>The <I>sites</I> style dump file is in the same format that is read by the
<A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command.  The dumped files can thus be
used as restart files to continue a simulation, using the
<A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>vkt</I> style dump file is in the VTI format that can be read by
various visualization programs, including
<A HREF = "http://www.paraview.org">ParaView</A>.
</P>
<P>The <I>stitch</I> style dump file is in an SQLite format which can be read
by the <A HREF = "set.html">set stitch</A> command or auxiliary tools provided with
the Stitch library in lib/stitch.  See the examples/stitch dir for
examples of SPPARKS scripts that read and write <I>stitch</I> files.
</P>
<P>As described below, the filename determines the kind of output (text
or binary or gzipped, one big file or one per timestep, one big file
or one per processor or one file per group of processors).  The fields
included in each snapshot are obtained from the application.  Only
<A HREF = "app_style.html">on-lattice and off-lattice applications</A> support dumps
since they are spatial in nature.  More that one dump command and
output file can be used during a simulation by giving each a unique
dump-ID and unique filename.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When running in parallel, unless the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify
sort</A> option is invoked, the lines of per-site
information written to dump files will be in an indeterminate order,
i.e. not ordered by site ID.  This is because the sites owned by each
processor are written in a contiguous chunk.  The ordering will be the
same in every snapshot.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Dump snapshots will only be written on timesteps where the system time
is a multiple of <I>delta</I>.  Depending on now time advances in the
application and solver (kinetic MC or rejection MC), the system time
for a snapshot may be somewhat larger than an exact multiple of
<I>delta</I>.  I.e. SPPARKS will trigger the snapshot on the first timestep
that the system time advances to a value >= a new delta interval.
</P>
<P>Note that this means snapshots will not be written at the beginning or
very end of a run, if the system time is not a multiple of delta.
If multiple runs are performed, the same snapshot will not be
written at the end of one run and the beginning of the next.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "dump_modify">dump_modify</A> command can be used to alter the times
at which snapshots are written out as well as define a subset of sites
to write out.  See the <I>delay</I>, <I>delta</I>, <I>logfreq</I>, <I>loglinfreq</I>, and
<I>tol</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "dump_modify">dump_modify</A> command for details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>text</I> format file, each snapshot begins with lines like
these:
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: TIMESTEP TIME
100   3.23945 
</PRE>
<P>The first field "100" denotes which snapshot it is, numbered as
0,1,2,etc.  Snapshot 0 is thus typically for the state of the system
before the first <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  The second field "3.23945"
is the simualtion time when the snapshot is generated.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The second simulation time field is an addition to the
standard LAMMPS-style header for each snapshot.
</P>
<P>The next lines are like these:
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: NUMBER OF ATOMS
314159 
</PRE>
<P>The word "ATOMS" is LAMMPS syntax, but simply means the number of
sites in a SPPARKS simulation.  The number "314159" will reflect any
reduction in dumped site count due to the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>The next lines are like these:
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: BOX BOUNDS
0 50
0 50
0 50 
</PRE>
<P>which denote the simulation box size in x,y,z.  E.g, the last
line is zlo and zhi.
</P>
<P>The next line is like this:
</P>
<P>ITEM: ATOMS id type x y z 
</P>
<P>which begins the per-site information.  One line per site follows.
The trailing "id type x y z" are labels for the per-site columns,
using the requested fields in the dump command.  The word "site" is
converted to "type" so as to be compatible with how LAMMPS-style dump
files are visualized.  The LAMMPS default is to use the "type" value
to color the object (e.g. a sphere) drawn at each site.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>sites</I> format file, each snapshot begins with lines like
these.
</P>
<PRE>Site file written by dump sites 2 command at time: 3 3.01 
</PRE>
<PRE>3 dimension
1000 sites
id site columns
0 10 xlo xhi
0 10 ylo yhi
0 10 zlo zhi 
</PRE>
<P>This is followed by a "Values" section of per-site info, with one line
per site.  Each line begins with a site ID, followed by the per-site
values listed in the "columns" header line
</P>
<P>See the "read_sites" command for more explanation of this format.  The
two time fields at the end of the first (comment) line are the same
TIME info described above the the <I>text</I> style format.  The "id site"
keywords that preceed "columns" define what per-site values are
included in the file.  The keyword "id" must be the first value in
each per-site line.  One or more per-site values can follow.  Note
that it only makes sense to include the "site" or "iN" or "dN" fields
as output values, since the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command can
only process those as input.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: For this style, a filename with the "*" wildcard must
be used so that a different file is written for each snapshot.  The is
because the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command only reads a file
with a single snapshot.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: This style of dump command will not write "Sites" or
"Neighbors" sections to the sites file.  When using the sites file to
continue a simulation, it is assumed that the restart script will
define the sites and their neighbors in an alternate way, e.g. via the
"create_box" and "create_sites" commands.  Or by reading a separate
sites file with that information via an earlies "read sites" command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: You must write information for all sites to the
<I>sites</I> style dump file.  E.g. you cannot use the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command to limit the output to a subset
of sites.  This is because the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> requires
information for all sites in the system.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>vtk</I> format file, each snapshot is wrapped with a
VTK-specific header and footer.  Only a single field can be listed,
which must be a per-site value, e.g. "site" or "iN" or "dN".
</P>
<P>A VTK-compatible visualization program will read the information in
the dump snapshot and display one object (e.g. a cube or sphere) at
each point on a regular 1d or 2d or 3d lattice.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Use of the "dump_modify vtk" command is required to
use this dump style.  This is to make additional simulation-specific
settings included in the VTK-compatible dump file.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>vtk</I> style can only be used to dump sites that
are on a simple, regular lattice.  In 1d, this is a "line/2n" lattice.
In 2d, this is a square lattice, "sq/4n" or "sq/8n".  In 3d, this is a
simple cubic lattice, "sc/6n" or "sc/26n".  See the
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> and <A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> commands
for details on these lattice types.
</P>
<P>If a <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command was used to create sites, then
SPPARKS will check that the lattice is one of these valid styles.
However, if a <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command was used to define
sites, e.g. by reading a previous <I>sites</I>-style dump file to continue
a simulation, then no lattice is defined and SPPARKS cannot check
this.  It is up to you to insure the VTK output meets this
restriction.  Otherwise a visualization program may not be able to
render a useful image.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify sort</A> command must
be used to insure the per-site info for the regular lattice is written
to the dump file in the regular ordering that VTK expects.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: For this style, a filename with the "*" wildcard must
be used so that a different file is written for each snapshot.
</P>
<HR>

<P>As mentioned above, the <I>stitch</I> format file is in an SQLite
format.
</P>
<P>In principle, any tool or library which reads SQLite files should be
able to read a <I>stitch</I> file, but that is not recommended, For
performance reasons, the Python or C API defind by the Stitch library
should be used for reading and writing stitch files.  SPPARKS itself
reads <I>stitch</I> files using the <A HREF = "set.html">set stitch</A> command.  Only a
filename representing a single file (no wildcards) can be used with
this style.  A time stamp and associated SPPARKS simulation time for
each snapshot is written into the SQLite file.
</P>
<P>Note that style <I>stitch</I> can only be used for simple regular lattices.
This means lattice = line (line/2n) for 1d models, square (sq/4n or
sq/8n) for 2d, or simple cubic (sc/6n or sc/26n) for 3d.  See the
<A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command for more details.  Many of
the <A HREF = "dump_modify">dump_modify</A> options are ignored for this style.
Snapshots for the entire lattice are written to the file.  More info
about <I>stitch</I> dump files will be added to this doc page later.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Only the specified fields will be included in the dump file for each
site.  If no fields are listed, then a default set of fields are
output, namely "id site x y z".
</P>
<P>These are the possible field values which may be specified.
</P>
<P>The <I>id</I> is a unique integer ID for each site.
</P>
<P>The <I>site</I>, <I>iN</I>, and <I>dN</I> fields specify a per-site value.  <I>Site</I> is
the same as <I>i1</I>.  <I>iN</I> fields are integer values for integer fields 1
to N; <I>dN</I> fields are floating-point values.  The application defines
how many integer and floating-point values are stored for each site.
</P>
<P>The <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I> values are the coordinates of the site.
</P>
<P>The <I>energy</I> value is what is computed by the energy() function in the
application.  Likewise for the <I>propensity</I> value which can be thought
of as the relative probablity for that site to perform a KMC event.
Note that if the application only performs rejection KMC or Metropolis
MC, then no propensity is defined.
</P>




<HR>

<P>The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.
The default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the
dump command is invoked and closed when an <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A>
command is used or when SPPARKS exits.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all dump styles support all the filename options
described next.  See the Restrictions section below for details.
</P>
<P>Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
This is a counter which starts at 0, and is incremented for each
snapshot.  For example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1,
tmp.dump.2, etc.  The initial value for this counter defaults to 0,
but can be reset via the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A> command.
</P>
<P>If a "%" character appears in the filename, then one file is written
for each processor and the "%" character is replaced with the
processor ID from 0 to P-1.  For example, tmp.dump.% becomes
tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, ... tmp.dump.P-1, etc.  This creates smaller
files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that
support parallel I/O for output.
</P>
<P>Note that the "*" and "%" characters can be used together to produce a
large number of small dump files!
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".bin", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file
will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically
write out much faster.  Of course, when post-processing, you will need
to convert it back to text format, using your own code to read the
binary file.  The format of the binary file can be understood by
looking at the src/dump.cpp file.
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".gz", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in gzipped format.  A gzipped dump file
will be about 3x smaller than the text version, but will also take
longer to write.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of on-lattice or off-lattice
applications.  See the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for further
details.
</P>
<P>The <I>stitch</I> style is part the STITCH package.  It is only enabled if
SPPARKS was built with that package.  See <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Section
2.3</A> for more info on how to do this.
</P>
<P>For the filename specified for the <I>sites</I> or <I>vtk</I> styles, a "*"
wildcard must be used and a "%" wildcard cannot be used.  Likewise a
"*.bin" suffix cannot be used, but a "*.gz" suffix can be used.
</P>
<P>To write gzipped dump files, you must compile SPPARKS with the
-DSPPARKS_GZIP option - see the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_2">Making
SPPARKS</A> section of the documentation.
