<H3>7. Additional tools 
</H3>
<P>SPPARKS is designed to be a Monte Carlo (MC) kernel for performing
kinetic MC or Metropolis MC computations.  Additional pre- and
post-processing steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a
simulation.  This section describes additional tools that may be
useful.
</P>
<P>Users can extend SPPARKS by writing diagnostic classes that perform
desired analysis or computations.  See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> for more info.
</P>
<P>Our group has written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "https://lammps.github.io/pizza">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools which may be useful for setup,
analysis, plotting, and visualization of SPPARKS simulations.
Pizza.py is written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download
from <A HREF = "https://lammps.github.io/pizza">the Pizza.py WWW site</A>.
</P>
