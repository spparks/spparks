<H3>7. Additional tools 
</H3>
<P>SPPARKS is designed to be a Monte Carlo (MC) kernel for performing
kinetic MC or Metropolis MC computations.  Additional pre- and
post-processing steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a
simulation.  This section describes additional tools that may be
useful.
</P>
<P>Users can extend SPPARKS by writing diagnostic classes that perform
desired analysis or computations.  See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this
section</A> for more info.
</P>
<P>Stitch is the primary mechanism for IO in spparks, at least for 
potts related models for grain growth and additive manufacturing 
simulations.  A python script in tools/stitch/plot_stitch_cut.py 
demonstrates how to read and plot perpendicular cuts/images 
from a spparks simulation.  Sphinx documentation for stitch 
can be built using the doc sources in lib/stitch/docs.
</P>
<P>External tools like <A HREF = "https://www.ovito.org">ovito</A> can also be used 
to visualize outputs -- especially text outputs such as dump files.
</P>
<P>Another external toolkit called <A HREF = "https://lammps.github.io/pizza">Pizza.py</A> can be used to setup, analyze,
plot, and visualize data for SPPARKS simulations.  Pizza.py is written
in "Python" and is available for download from <A HREF = "https://lammps.github.io/pizza">the Pizza.py WWW
site</A>.
</P>




<P>Addtional scripts below are distributed with spparks under the tools directory.
</P>
<LI>crystalline_orientations/cpp_quaternion.py: enables reading spparks quaternion header files 

<LI>crystalline_orientations/plot_cubic_symmetry_histograms.py: verification plots for disorientation distribution 
of randomly oriented cubic structures 

<LI>crystalline_orientations/plot_hcp_symmetry_histograms.py: verification plots for disorientation distribution 
of randomly oriented hcp structures
