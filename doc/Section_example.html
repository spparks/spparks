<H3>5. Example problems 
</H3>
<P>The SPPARKS distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems. Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own. Each problem has an input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*). Some examples produce a Stitch file and/or a dump file
(dump.*).
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">Additional Tools</A> for visualization of outputs.
</P>
<P>These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:

<P>Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:
</P>
<PRE>cd examples/potts_quaternion
mpirun -np 8 ../../src/spk_mpi -in in.potts_cubic_2d # run the problem 
</PRE>
<P>Running the simulation produces the files <I>potts_cubic_2d.st</I> and
<I>log.spparks</I>.
</P>
<P>If you add <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> line(s) to the input script a
series of JPG images will be produced by the run. 
For potts_quaternion in.potts_cubic_2d script the following line can be
added for example
</P>
<PRE>% dump top image 1 potts_init.top.*.jpg site site view 0.0 0.0 crange 1 100000 drange 1 1 zoom 2.0 size 1024 1024 
</PRE>
<P>These can be viewed individually or turned into a movie or animated 
by tools like ImageMagick or QuickTime or various image editing tools. 
See the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page for more details. The 
</P>
<P>Imagemagick command to create a GIF file suitable for viewing in a 
</P>
<P>browser would be (based on the above dump command):
</P>
<PRE>% convert -loop 1 -delay 20 potts_init.top.*.jpg my_animation.gif 
</PRE>
<P>For the potts_quaternion simulations per grain crystalline orientations are available enabling 
direct comparison with experimental EBSD datasets. Moreover SPPARKS crystalline orientations 
</P>
<P>can be directly incorporated into existing EBSD post-processing and analysis packages like Orix/MTEX.
Additional analysis tools for stitch files are available in the spparks/tools directory.
</P>
<HR>

<P>There is also a COUPLE directory with examples of how to use SPPARKS
as a library, either by itself or in tandem with another code or
library.  See the COUPLE/README file to get started.
