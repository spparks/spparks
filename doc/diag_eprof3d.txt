diag_style eprof3d command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style eprof3d keyword value keyword value ... :pre

eprof3d = style name of this diagnostic :ulb,l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {axis} or {filename} or {boundary} :l
  {axis} value = {x} or {y} or {z}
    x,y,z = which axis to measure energy profile with respect to
  {filename} value = name
    name = name of file to write results to
  {boundary} value = none :pre
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to any diagnostic command :l,ule

[Examples:]

diag_style eprof3d stats no delt 0.1 axis x filename eprof3d.dat
diag_style eprof3d filename eprof3d.dat boundary :pre

[Description:]

The eprof3d diagnostic computes a one-dimensional 
average energy profile for all the lattice sites in the system.

The {axis} keyword specifices which axis to use as the profile
coordinate.

The {filename} keyword allows a file to be specified which output
is written to.

If the {boundary} keyword is used, the average energy is provided as a
function of distance from the nearest sector boundary.  In this case,
the overall average energy and the average energy immediately to the
left and right of the sector boundary is printed as stats output 
via the "stats"_stats.html command. Also, in this case, 
the {axis} keyword has no effect.

If the {boundary} keyword is not used, then only the overall average
energy is printed as stats output via the "stats"_stats.html command.

[Restrictions:]

As described by the "app_style"_app_style.html command, on-lattice
applications use one of 3 styles of lattice: general, 2d, or 3d.  For
this diagnostic only applications on 3d lattices are currently
supported.
