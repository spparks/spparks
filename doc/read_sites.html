<H3>read_sites command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>read_sites file 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>file = name of data file to read in 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>read_sites data.potts
read_sites ../run7/data.potts.gz 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read in a data file containing information SPPARKS needs to setup an
<A HREF = "app_style.html">on-lattice or off-lattice application</A>.  The file can
be ASCII text or a gzipped text file (detected by a .gz suffix).  This
is one of 2 ways to specify event sites ; see the
<A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command for another method.
</P>
<P>A data file has a header and a body, as described below.  The body of
the file contains up to 3 sections: Sites, Neighbors, Values.  Sites
defines the coordinates of event sites.  Neighbors define the
neighbors of each site (only for on-lattice applications).  Values
assign per-site values to each site, which can also be done via the
<A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command.
</P>
<P>The read_sites command can be used in one of 3 scenarios:
</P>
<P>If a simulation box has not already been created and no event sites
exist, then the data file defines the box size (in the header), and it
must define Sites.  It must also define Neighbors for on-lattice
applications.  The Values section is optional, since these can be set
later via the <A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command.
</P>
<P>If a simulation box has already been defined (by the "create_box"
command or a previous read_sites command), but no sites have previosly
been defined, then the data file must define Sites.  It must also
define Neighbors for on-lattice applications.  The Values section is
optional.
</P>
<P>If a simulation box has already been defined, and sites have previosly
been defined (by the "create_sites" command or a previous read_sites
command), then no Sites or Neighbors can be specfied, but the Values
section may be used.  This is a means of restarting a simulation using
per-site info written out by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command and
reformatted into a data file so it can be input by this command.
</P>
<P>Note that the periodicity of the simulation box, as defined by the
<A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary</A> command is not considered by this command
when defining sites or neighbors.  It is up to you to insure sites are
not duplicated on a periodic boundary, or that a site's neighbor list
does not include sites that are on the other side of the simulation
box, across a non-periodic boundary.  This is in contrast to the
<A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command which accounts for both of
these issues when creating sites and neighbor lists.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The first line of the header of the data file is always skipped; it
typically contains a description of the file.  Then lines are read one
at a time.  Lines can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that
is ignored.  If the line is blank (only whitespace after comment is
deleted), it is skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the
corresponding value(s) is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a
header keyword, the line begins the body of the file. 
</P>
<P>The body of the file contains zero or more sections.  The first line
of a section has only a keyword.  The next line is skipped.  The
remaining lines of the section contain values.  The number of lines
depends on the section keyword as described below.  Zero or more blank
lines can be used between sections.  Sections can appear in any order,
with a few exceptions as noted below.
</P>
<P>The formatting of individual lines in the data file (indentation,
spacing between words and numbers) is not important except that header
and section keywords (e.g. dimension, xlo xhi, Sites, Values) must be
capitalized as shown and can't have extra white space between their
words - e.g. two spaces or a tab between "xlo and "xhi" is not valid.
</P>
<HR>

<P>These are the recognized header keywords.  Header lines can come in
any order.  The value(s) are read from the beginning of the line.
Thus the keyword <I>sites</I> should be in a line like "1000 sites"; the
keyword <I>ylo yhi</I> should be in a line like "-10.0 10.0 ylo yhi".  All
these settings have a default value of 0, except the lo/hi box size
defaults which are -0.5 and 0.5.  A line need only appear if the value
is different than the default.  If the keyword values have already
been defined (e.g. box sizes for a previously created simulation box),
then the values in the data file must match.
</P>
<UL><LI><I>dimension</I> = dimension of system = 1,2,3
<LI><I>sites</I> = number of sites
<LI><I>max neighbors</I> = max # of neighbors of any site
<LI><I>xlo xhi</I> = simulation box boundaries in x dimension
<LI><I>ylo yhi</I> = simulation box boundaries in y dimension
<LI><I>zlo zhi</I> = simulation box boundaries in z dimension 
</UL>
<P>The <I>max neighbors</I> setting is only needed if the file contains a
Neighbors section, which is only used for on-lattice applications.
</P>
<P>The simulation box size is determined by the lo/hi settings.  For 2d
simulations, the <I>zlo zhi</I> values should be set to bound the z coords
for atoms that appear in the file; the default of -0.5 0.5 is valid if
all z coords are 0.0.  The same rules hold for <I>ylo and yhi</I> for 1d
simulations.
</P>
<HR>

<P>These are the possible section keywords for the body of the file:
<I>Sites, Neighbors, Values</I>.
</P>
<P>Each section is listed below.  The format of each section is described
including the number of lines it must contain and rules (if any) for
where it can appear in the data file.
</P>
<P>Any individual line in the various sections can have a trailing
comment starting with "#" for annotation purposes.  E.g. in the
Sites section:
</P>
<P>10 10.0 5.0 6.0   # impuity site
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Sites</I> section:
</P>
<UL><LI>one line per site 

<LI>line syntax: ID x y z 

<PRE>ID = global site ID (1-N)
x y z = coordinates of site 
</PRE>
<LI>example: 

<PRE>101 7.0 0.0 3.0 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>There must be N lines in this section where N = number of sites and is
defined by the <I>sites</I> keyword in the header section of the file.
The lines can appear in any order.
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Neighbors</I> section:
</P>
<UL><LI>one line per site 

<LI>line syntax: ID n1 n2 n3 ... 

<PRE>ID = global site ID (1-N)
n1 n2 n3 ... = IDs of neighbor sites 
</PRE>
<LI>example: 

<PRE>101 7 32 15 1004 ... 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>There must be N lines in this section where N = number of sites and is
defined by the <I>sites</I> keyword in the header section of the file.
The lines can appear in any order.
</P>
<P>The number of neighbors can vary from site to site, but there can be
no more than <I>max neighbors</I> for any one site.  The neighbors of an
individual site can be listed in any order.
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Values</I> section:
</P>
<UL><LI>one line per site 

<LI>line syntax: ID i1 i2 ... iN d1 d2 ... dN 

<PRE>ID = global site ID (1-N)
i1,i2,...iN = integer values for the site
d1,d2,...dN = floating point values for the site 
</PRE>
<LI>example: 

<PRE>101 1 3 4.0 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>There must be N lines in this section where N = number of sites and is
defined by the <I>sites</I> keyword in the header section of the file.
The lines can appear in any order.
</P>
<P>The number of values per site that should be listed depends on the
application which defines the number of integer and floating-point
values per site.  These are listed in order, with the integer values
first, followed by the floating-point values.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

<P>To write gzipped dump files, you must compile SPPARKS with the
-DSPPARKS_GZIP option - see the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_2">Making
SPPARKS</A> section of the documentation.
