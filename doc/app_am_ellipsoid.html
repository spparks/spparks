<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an on-lattice application derived from the <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style
potts/neighonly</A> application that simulates the
rastering of a molten pool and its accompanying heat-affected zone
(HAZ) through a domain.  Rastering is achieved through the
specification of layer-by-layer patterns, which can be combined into
an overall pattern specifying the translation of the molten zone
through the entire simulation domain. The application allows for
arbitrary numbers of paths in each layer and an arbitrary number of
layers in each pattern. Thus, the user can construct any scan strategy
desired by specifying individual layer patterns and how these patterns
should be repeated.
</P>
<P>The molten pool is defined as a double ellipsoid. The ellipsoids share
identical values for two of their axes (defined by the <I>melt_width</I>
and <I>melt_depth</I> parameters). The third axis of each ellipsoid is
defined by either the <I>melt_tail_length</I> or <I>cap_height</I>
parameters. The haz is also defined by four equivalent parameters:
<I>HAZ</I>, <I>tail_HAZ</I>, <I>depth_HAZ</I>, and <I>cap_HAZ</I>. A schematic of these
eight parameters is shown below.

<IMG SRC = "JPG/400am_pool_schematic.png">

<P>The model also requires specification of the <I>exp_factor</I> variable,
which determines the value of the coefficient in the mobility
equation, <I>M = exp(-exp_factor * x)</I>, where <I>x</I> is the shortest
distance from the lattice site to the molten pool boundary.

<P>The following additional commands are typically used by this
application.  A layer must be defined by using <A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am
cartesian_layer</A> or <A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am
path_layer</A>.  A layer requires one to many <A HREF = "am_path.html">am
path</A> commands or at least one <A HREF = "am_pass.html">am pass</A>
command.
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "am_pass.html">am pass</A>: Specify pass parameters used to construct
<I>cartesian_layer</I>. 

<LI><A HREF = "am_path.html">am path</A>: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points
on a layer; sequence of <I>am path</I>s are used to construct an <A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am
path_layer</A>. 

<LI><A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am cartesian_layer</A>: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from <I>am pass</I> and other parameters.
