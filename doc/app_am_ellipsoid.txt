app_style am/ellipsoid command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style am/ellipsoid nspins spot_width melt_tail_length melt_depth cap_height HAZ tail_HAZ depth_HAZ cap_HAZ exp_factor :pre

am/ellipsoid = application style name :l
nspins = number of possible spins :l
spot_width = maximum width of the melt pool :l
melt_tail_length = maximum length of the melt pool trailing the melt spot :l
melt_depth = maximum depth of the melt pool :l
cap_height = maximum length of the melt pool leading the melt spot :l
HAZ = width of the heat affected zone (haz) surrounding the melt pool (must be larger than width) :l
tail_HAZ = Length of the haz trailing the meltpool (must be larger than tail_length) :l
depth_HAZ = depth of the heat affect zone (haz) below the melt pool (must be larger than depth) :l
cap_HAZ = Length of haz leading the melt pool (must be larger than cap_length) :l
exp_factor = Coefficient that controls the rate of exponential decay of the haz mobility gradient :l

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application derived from the "app_style
potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html application that simulates the
rastering of a molten pool and its accompanying heat-affected zone
(HAZ) through a domain.  Rastering is achieved through the
specification of layer-by-layer patterns, which can be combined into
an overall pattern specifying the translation of the molten zone
through the entire simulation domain. The application allows for
arbitrary numbers of paths in each layer and an arbitrary number of
layers in each pattern. Thus, the user can construct any scan strategy
desired by specifying individual layer patterns and how these patterns
should be repeated.

The molten pool is defined as a double ellipsoid. The ellipsoids share
identical values for two of their axes (defined by the {melt_width}
and {melt_depth} parameters). The third axis of each ellipsoid is
defined by either the {melt_tail_length} or {cap_height}
parameters. The haz is also defined by four equivalent parameters:
{HAZ}, {tail_HAZ}, {depth_HAZ}, and {cap_HAZ}. A schematic of these
eight parameters is shown below.

The model also requires specification of the {exp_factor} variable,
which determines the value of the coefficient in the mobility
equation, {M = exp(-exp_factor * x)}, where {x} is the shortest
distance from the lattice site to the molten pool boundary.

This application was used in the paper by "Rodgers and
collaborators"_#Rodgers.

The following additional commands are typically used by this
application.  A layer must be defined by using "am
cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html or "am
path_layer"_am_path_layer.html.  A layer requires one to many "am
path"_am_path.html commands or at least one "am pass"_am_pass.html
command.

"am pass"_am_pass.html: Specify pass parameters used to construct
{cartesian_layer}. :ulb,l

"am path"_am_path.html: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points
on a layer; sequence of {am path}s are used to construct an "am
path_layer"_am_path_layer.html. :l

"am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from {am pass} and other parameters. :l

"am build"_am_build.html: May be used for combinations of layers that
comprise a pattern. :l,ule

The examples/potts_additive directory has input files which illustrate
use of these additional commands.

[Restrictions:] :link(restriction)

This application is only compatible with square and square cubic
lattices. 

This application can only be evolved by a rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  See the "sweep"_sweep.html command for more details.

The settings for melt pool width + haz must be <= xhi & yhi.
