diag_style propensity command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style propensity keyword value keyword value ... :pre

propensity = style name of this diagnostic
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to a diagnostic command :ul

[Examples:]

diag_style propensity :pre

[Description:]

The propensity diagnostic computes the total propensity of all lattice
sites in the system. The propensity is printed as stats output via the
"stats"_stats.html command.

The propensity can be thought of as the relative probablity of a site
site to perform a KMC event.  Note that if you are doing Metropolis MC
and not kinetic MC, no propensity is defined.

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used for on-lattice applications.

This diagnostic can only be used for KMC simulations where a
"solver"_solve.html is defined.

[Related commands:]

"diag_style"_diag_style.html, "stats"_stats.html

[Default:] none
