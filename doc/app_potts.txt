app_style potts command :h3
app_style potts/neigh command :h3
app_style potts/neighonly command :h3
app_style potts/variable command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style Q keyword values ... :pre

style = {potts} or {potts/neigh} or {potts/neighonly} or {potts/variable}
Q = number of spin states
see the "app_style"_app_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended :ul

[Examples:]

app_style potts 100 lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50
app_style potts/neigh 20 lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50
app_style potts/variable 100 lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50 site 1 1 :pre

[Description:]

These applications evolve a Q-state Ising model or Potts model, where
each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q.  Sites flip their spin
as the model evolves.

The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:

Hi = Sum_j delta_ij :pre

where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 0 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 1 if they
are different.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.

These applications perform Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html for an Ising model which performs
Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two neighboring sites are
swapped.

The {potts/variable} application is identical to the {potts}
application except that the {site} keyword must be used to define the
per-site quantities stored on the lattice.  The {site} keyword is
described with the "app_style"_app_style.html command.  This
application is provided to illustrate how an application is written
using user-defined sites via the {site} keyword.

As explained on "this page"_app_style.html, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the "solve_style"_solve_style.html or
"sweep"_sweep.html commands.

For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min\[1,exp(-dE/kT)\], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
"temperature"_temperature.html command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).  The KMC algorithm does not allow spin flips
known as "wild" flips, even at finite temperature.  These are flips to
values that are not equal to any neighbor site value.

For solution by a rKMC algorithm, the various styles use different
rejection-based algorithms.  For the {potts} and {potts/variable}
styles, a random spin from 1 to Q is chosen.  For the {potts/neigh}
style, a spin is chosen randomly from the values held by neighbor
sites and a null-bin of a size which extends the possible events up to
the maximum number of neighbors.  For example, imagine a site has 12
neighbors and the 12 sites have 4 different spin values.  Then each of
the 4 neighbor spin values will be chosen with 1/12 probability and
the null bin will be chosen with 8/12 probability.  For the
{potts/neighonly} style, the null bin is discarded, so in this case
each of the 4 spin values will be chosen with 1/4 probability.  In all
the cases, dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform
random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if R <
min\[1,exp(-dE/kT)\], else it is rejected.

The rKMC algorithm for the {potts} style does allow spin flips known
as "wild" flips.  These are flips to values that are not equal to any
neighbor site value.  At temperature 0.0 these are effectively
disallowed, since they will increase the energy of the system (except
in the uninteresting case when the site already has a spin value not
equal to any neighbor values), but at finite temperature they will
have a non-zero probability of occurring.
