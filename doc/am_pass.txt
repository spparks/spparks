am pass command :h3

[Syntax:]

am pass id dir d speed V hatch h overhatch oh :pre

id = integer identification number for this pass
dir = required keyword
d = {X} or {Y} which specifies direction of the cartesian pass
speed = required keyword
V = scan speed of the pass in sites/Monte-Carlo-sweep
hatch = required keyword
h = hatch spacing distance 
overhatch = optional keyword
oh = perpindicular distance to pass dir; expands domain size :ul

[Examples:]

am pass 1 dir X speed 9 hatch 75
am pass 2 dir Y speed 10 hatch 50 overhatch 25 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used by "am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html, and
"potts/am_weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html to specify raster scan patterns
for rectangular domains. Multiple passes can be defined in a single
input file, each using unique id values. The {am pass} command is a
required subelement of "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html
that specifies a cartesian build layer in the {x,y} plane. The initial
heading, left or right for {dir=X} or up or down for {dir=Y} depends
upon the starting location specified in the "am
cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command.  By default, scan
lines are {serpentine} but this can be turned off in the "am
cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command.

The {pass} distance and number of {hatch} lines are controlled by the
{X,Y} extent of the domain specified using the "region"_region.html
command, which must be a box; multiple passes, seperated by {hatch}
spacing are invoked until the domain dimension perpindicular to the
scan {dir} is exhausted.  The optional {overhatch} value can be used
to cause additional scan lines.  The melt pool has its own local
coordinate system {x,y} so that the pool axis {x} is always oriented
along {dir d}.

The example commands above define two passes, each with a different
{dir}, {speed}, {hatch} and optional {overhatch}.
