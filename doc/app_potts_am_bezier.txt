app_style potts/am/bezier command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style	 potts/am/bezier nspins width depth haz

potts/am/bezier = application style name :l
nspins = number of possible spins :l
width = maximum width of the melt pool :l
depth = maximum depth of the melt pool :l
haz = fixed distance parameter from pool surface estimating extent of heat affected zone surrounding melt pool :l

:ule

[Examples:]

app_style	 potts/am/bezier 250000 130 65 5

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application derived from the "app_style
potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html application that simulates the
rastering of a molten pool and its accompanying heat-affected zone
(HAZ) through a domain.  Rastering is achieved through the
specification of layer-by-layer patterns, which can be combined into
an overall pattern specifying the translation of the molten zone
through the entire simulation domain. The application allows for
arbitrary numbers of paths in each layer and an arbitrary number of
layers in each pattern. Thus, the user can construct any scan strategy
desired by specifying individual layer patterns and how these patterns
should be repeated.

In addition to the above required inputs {width,depth,haz}, the model
requires specification of the melt pool surface via the 
"potts/am/bezier control_points"_potts_am_bezier.html command.  
Whereas "app_am ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html 
uses two ellipsoids to define the moving melt pool and heat effected zone,
here, the molten pool is defined by two fourth order Bezier curves: 1) top
surface curve; 2) spine curve.  The two curves are combined to form a {3D}
surface representing the interface between liquid and solidified material.  The
shape of the pool is defined by user input control points for the two curves
and may be obtained from laboratory images or through process simulation or
some other means.

Degree four Bezier curves require a total of five control points.  However,
symmetry of the melt pool across {xz-plane} and the bounding top surface plane
{z=0} reduce the number of required inputs.  Control points for the top surface
curve are input only for half the melt pool on account of symmetry; because the
front and tail of pool start at {y=0} only three {y} components of the top
curve are required while the other two components are implicitly set to 0 by
the app.  Similarly, because the spine curve begins and ends at the top surface
{z=0} only three components of {z} control points are required.  Both the top
surface curve and spine curve use the same {x} component values and all five
are required inputs. Melt pool width and depth is explicitly set according to
user inputs {width}, {depth} whereas melt pool length is implicitly defined by
the ratio {width/length} according to the input top surface curve control
points.  The {x,y} components of the top curve control points are scaled to
achieve the user input pool width.  Similarly, spine curve control point components 
{x,z} are scaled to specified melt pool depth.  However, the final set of {x}
components used for both the top surface curve and spine curve are values
obtained from the width scaling operation.  

The following command defined by this application must be used to
specify the bezier melt pool surface geometry as described above.

"potts/am/bezier"_potts_am_bezier.html: Specifies control points and convexity of surface.  :tb(s=:)

:line

Some combination of the following additional commands are typically used by this
application to specify a raster pattern.
A layer must be defined by using "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html or 
"am path_layer"_am_path_layer.html.  A layer requires one to many "am path"_am_path.html 
commands or at least one "am pass"_am_pass.html
command.

"am pass"_am_pass.html: Specify pass parameters used to construct
{cartesian_layer}. :ulb,l

"am path"_am_path.html: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points
on a layer; sequence of {am path}s are used to construct an 
"am path_layer"_am_path_layer.html. :l

"am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from {am pass} and other parameters. :l

"am build"_am_build.html: May be used for combinations of layers that
comprise a pattern. :l,ule

The examples/potts_am_bezier directory has input files which illustrate
use of some of these commands. However these commands 
are not unique to this app and other examples within the examples directory 
may also further illustrate.

[Restrictions:] :link(restriction)

This application is only compatible with square and square cubic
lattices. 

This application can only be evolved by a rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  See the "sweep"_sweep.html command for more details.
