<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an optional command used by
<A HREF = "app_am_ellipsoid.html">am/ellipsoid</A> and
<A HREF = "app_potts_am_weld.html">potts/am/weld</A> applications to specify
multilayer build simulations.  The command allows for re-use of layer
specifications and implicitly creates a pattern of layers.  The build
pattern is implied by the order and number of layers in the input
script.  As is conventional, the build proceeds in the z-direction
according to specified layer thicknesses.  The <I>am build start</I>
parameter specifies the top surface of build plane; its important to
specify this parameter if the spparks domain is thicker than a build
layer otherwise the default value will be <I>zhi</I> taken from region box
which is probably not desired.  Once all layers have been
built/simulated, the pattern repeats, cycling through the layers again
and again until <I>num_layers</I> have been simulated.  The <I>am build</I>
command allows for defining an arbitrary number of layers and
patterns.
</P>
<P>This command is mostly intended for SPPARKS simulations that do not
use Stitch IO; nonetheless, this command can be used with Stitch IO.
Simulations using Stitch IO would normally proceed layer-by-layer
using only one layer in any particular simulation.  If this command is
omitted then the pattern of layers in the input script is only
simulated once.
</P>
<P>In Example 1, one layer is simulated.  Because <I>thickness t=10</I>, <I>am
build start z=10</I> is specified.
</P>
<P>In Example 2 above, 2 layers are defined but 4 layers are simulated;
layers are alternately rastered in <I>X</I> then <I>Y</I> directions starting at
the LL corner and alternately the LR corner.  As in Example 1, because
first layer <I>thickness t=10</I>, the <I>start</I> value is set at <I>am build
start z=10</I>.
