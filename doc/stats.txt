stats command :h3

[Syntax:]

stats delta keyword values ... :pre

delta = time increment between statistical output (seconds) :ulb,l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {logfreq} :l
  {logfreq} values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval :pre
:ule
    
[Examples:]

stats 0.1
stats 1.0 logfreq 7 10.0 :pre

[Description:]

Print statistics to the screen and log file every so many seconds
during a simulation.  A value of 0.0 for delta means only print
stats at the beginning and end of the run.

The quantities printed are elapsed CPU time followed by those provided
by the "application"_app_style.html, followed by those provided by any
"diagnostics"_diag_style.html you have defined.

Typically the application reports only the number of events or sweeps
executed, followed by the simulation time, but other
application-specific quantities may also be reported.  Quantities such
as the total energy of the system can be included in the output by
creating diagnostics via the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command.

Using the {logfreq} keyword will produce statistical output at varying
intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be {N}
outputs per interval where the size of the interval is initially
{delta} and then scales up by {factor} each time.

For example, this command

stats 0.1 logfreq 7 10.0 :pre

will produce output at these times:

t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.7, 1, 2, ...., 7, 10, 20, .... :pre

This command

stats 0.1 logfreq 1 2.0 :pre

will produce output at these times:

t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, ... :pre

[Restrictions:]

See the doc pages for quantities provided by particular
"app_style"_app_style.html and "diag_style"_diag_style.html commands
for further details.

[Related commands:]

"dump"_dump.html, "diag_style"_diag_style.html

[Default:]

The default stats increment is delta = 0.0.
