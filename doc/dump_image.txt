[Examples:]

dump myDump image 100 dump.*.jpg site site
dump myDump image 100 dump.*.jpg energy i2 :pre

[Description:]

Dump a high-quality ray-traced image of the sites at time intervals of
{delta} during a simulation as either a JPG or PPM file.  A series of
such images can easily be converted into an animated movie of your
simulation; see further details below.  The {text} dump style writes
snapshots of numerical data asociated with sites, as discussed on the
"dump"_dump.html doc page.

Here are two sample images, rendered as 1024x1024 JPG files.  The left
image is a million-site lattice; the right image is half a billion
sites.  Click to see the full-size images:

<DIV ALIGN=center>

:image(JPG/image_1M_small.jpg,JPG/image_1M.jpg)
:image(JPG/image_512M_small.jpg,JPG/image_512M.jpg)

</DIV>

The "dump_modify"_dump_modify.html command can be used to alter the
times at which images are written out as well as alter what sites are
included in the image.

The filename suffix determines whether a JPG or PPM file is created.
If the suffix is ".jpg" or ".jpeg", then a JPG file is created, else a
PPM file is created, which is a text-based format.  To write out JPG
files, you must build SPPARKS with a JPEG library.  See "this
section"_Section_start.html#2_2 of the manual for instructions on how
to do this.

:line

Dump image filenames must contain a wildcard character "*", so that
one image file per snapshot is written.  The "*" character is replaced
with the timestep value.  For example, tmp.dump.*.jpg becomes
tmp.dump.0.jpg, tmp.dump.10000.jpg, tmp.dump.20000.jpg, etc.  Note
that the "dump_modify pad"_dump_modify.html command can be used to
insure all timestep numbers are the same length (e.g. 00010), which
can make it easier to convert a series of images into a movie in the
correct ordering.

:line

The {color} and {diameter} settings determine the color and size of
sites rendered in the image.  They can be any attribute defined for
the "dump text"_dump.html command, including {site}.  Note that the
{diameter} setting can be overridden with a numeric value by the
optional {sdiam} keyword, in which case you can specify the {diameter}
setting with any valid atom attribute.

If an integer attribute such as {site} or {i2} is specified for the
{color} setting, then you must use the optional {crange} keyword to
specify the range of integer values that are allowed, from {lo} to
{hi}.  The color of each site is determined by the integer value.  By
default the mapping of values to colors is done by looping over the
set of pre-defined colors listed with the
"dump_modify"_dump_modify.html command, and assiging the first one to
value lo, the next to value lo+1, and so on, repeating the assignment
in a loop if the number of values exceeds the number of pre-defined
colors.  This mapping can be changed by the "dump_modify
scolor"_dump_modify.html command.

If a floating point attribute such as {energy} or {d1} is specified
for the {color} setting, then the site's attribute will be associated
with a specific color via a "color map", which can be specified via
the "dump_modify"_dump_modify.html command.  The basic idea is that
the attribute will be within a range of values, and every value within
the range is mapped to a specific color.  Depending on how the color
map is defined, that mapping can take place via interpolation so that
a value of -3.2 is halfway between "red" and "blue", or discretely so
that the value of -3.2 is "orange".

If an integer attribute such as {site} or {i2} is specified for the
{diameter} setting, then you must use the optional {drange} keyword to
specify the range of integer values that are allowed.  The size of
each site is determined by the integer value.  By default all values
has diameter 1.0.  This mapping can be changed by the "dump_modify
sdiam"_dump_modify.html command.

If a floating point attribute such as {energy} or {d1} is specified
for the {diameter} setting, then the site will be rendered using the
site's attribute as the diameter.  If the per-site value <= 0.0, then
the site will not be drawn.

:line

The various keywords listed above control how the image is rendered.
As listed below, all of the keywords have defaults, most of which you
will likely not need to change.  The "dump modify"_dump_modify.html
also has options specific to the dump image style, particularly for
assigning colors to atoms, bonds, and other image features.

:line

The {shape} keyword can be specied with a value of {sphere} or {cube},
to draw either a sphere or cube at each site.  Cubes typically only
make sense for simple square or cubic lattices with regular spacing,
so that the cubes will tile the 2d or 3d space without overlapping.
The diameter specified for each site will be the diamter of the sphere
or the edge length of the cube.

:line

The {sdiam} keyword allows you to override the {diameter} setting with
a specified numeric value.  All sites will be drawn with that
diameter.

:line

The {boundary} keyword enables drawing of boundaries bewteen
neighboring sites that have a different value of the specified
attribute.  This is a way to visualize the boundary between two
contiguous groups of sites based on an attribute that is different for
the two groups, even if the sites themselves in the 2 groups are
rendered with the same color (due to the value of their {color}
setting).

The specified {attribute} can be any attribute defined for the "dump
text"_dump.html command, including {site}.  A boundary is only drawn
between site pairs (I,J), where site I is rendered by the dump image
command, site J is one of its nearest neighbors, and the value of the
specified {attribute} is different for the 2 sites.

The boundary itself is drawn as 4 cylinders which outline a square.
If the 2 adjacent sites are rendered as cubes (via the {shape}
setting), then the square is the face common to the 2 adjacent cubes.
The diameter of the cylinders is set via the {bdiam} keyword.  The
color of the cylinders can be set via the "dump_modify
boundcolor"_dump_modify.html command.

:line

The {crange} keyword must be used if the specified {color} setting is
an integer attribute such as {site} or {i2}.  The {lo} and {hi} values
are the range of values that the attribute can have.  For example,
if spins in a Potts model will range from 1 to 100 (inclusive), then
{lo} and {hi} should be specified as 1 and 100.

Note that internally the code allocates a vector of color values that
is of length {hi}-{lo}+1.  Thus you may run out of memory if {crange}
encompasses N values and N is very large, e.g. 2 billion.  In this
case you should choose a smaller N, e.g. 10000, and use the
"dump_modify cwrap yes"_dump_modify.html command to wrap the 2 billion
possible values into N smaller values.

:line

The {drange} keyword must be used if the specified {diameter} setting
is an integer attribute such as {site} or {i2}, unless the {sdiam}
keyword is used, in which case the {diameter} setting is ignored.  The
{lo} and {hi} values are the range of values that the attribute can
have.  For example, if the {i2} attibute will take on the values -1,
0, or 1, then then {lo} and {hi} should be specified as -1 and 1

Note that internally the code allocates a vector of diameter values
that is of length {hi}-{lo}+1.  Thus you may run out of memory if
{drange} encompasses N values and N is very large, e.g. 2 billion.  In
this case you should choose a smaller N, e.g. 10000, and use the
"dump_modify dwrap yes"_dump_modify.html command to wrap the 2 billion
possible values into N smaller values.

:line

The {size} keyword sets the width and height of the created images,
i.e. the number of pixels in each direction.

:line

The {view}, {center}, {up}, {zoom}, and {persp} values determine how
3d simulation space is mapped to the 2d plane of the image.  Basically
they control how the simulation box appears in the image.

All of the {view}, {center}, {up}, {zoom}, and {persp} values can be
specified as numeric quantities, whose meaning is explained below.
Any of them can also be specified as an "equal-style
variable"_variable.html, by using v_name as the value, where "name" is
the variable name.  In this case the variable will be evaluated on the
timestep each image is created to create a new value.  If the
equal-style variable is time-dependent, this is a means of changing
the way the simulation box appears from image to image, effectively
doing a pan or fly-by view of your simulation.

The {view} keyword determines the viewpoint from which the simulation
box is viewed, looking towards the {center} point.  The {theta} value
is the vertical angle from the +z axis, and must be an angle from 0 to
180 degrees.  The {phi} value is an azimuthal angle around the z axis
and can be positive or negative.  A value of 0.0 is a view along the
+x axis, towards the {center} point.  If {theta} or {phi} are
specified via variables, then the variable values should be in
degrees.

The {center} keyword determines the point in simulation space that
will be at the center of the image.  {Cx}, {Cy}, and {Cz} are
speficied as fractions of the box dimensions, so that (0.5,0.5,0.5) is
the center of the simulation box.  These values do not have to be
between 0.0 and 1.0, if you want the simulation box to be offset from
the center of the image.  Note, however, that if you choose strange
values for {Cx}, {Cy}, or {Cz} you may get a blank image.  Internally,
{Cx}, {Cy}, and {Cz} are converted into a point in simulation space.
If {flag} is set to "s" for static, then this conversion is done once,
at the time the dump command is issued.  If {flag} is set to "d" for
dynamic then the conversion is performed every time a new image is
created.  If the box size or shape is changing, this will adjust the
center point in simulation space.

The {up} keyword determines what direction in simulation space will be
"up" in the image.  Internally it is stored as a vector that is in the
plane perpendicular to the view vector implied by the {theta} and
{pni} values, and which is also in the plane defined by the view
vector and user-specified up vector.  Thus this internal vector is
computed from the user-specified {up} vector as

up_internal = view cross (up cross view) :pre

This means the only restriction on the specified {up} vector is that
it cannot be parallel to the {view} vector, implied by the {theta} and
{phi} values.

The {zoom} keyword scales the size of the simulation box as it appears
in the image.  The default {zfactor} value of 1 should display an
image mostly filled by the atoms in the simulation box.  A {zfactor} >
1 will make the simulation box larger; a {zfactor} < 1 will make it
smaller.  {Zfactor} must be a value > 0.0.

The {persp} keyword determines how much depth perspective is present
in the image.  Depth perspective makes lines that are parallel in
simulation space appear non-parallel in the image.  A {pfactor} value
of 0.0 means that parallel lines will meet at infininty (1.0/pfactor),
which is an orthographic rendering with no persepctive.  A {pfactor}
value between 0.0 and 1.0 will introduce more perspective.  A {pfactor}
value > 1 will create a highly skewed image with a large amount of
perspective.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The {persp} keyword is not yet supported as an option.

:line

The {box} keyword determines how the simulation box boundaries are
rendered as thin cylinders in the image.  If {no} is set, then the box
boundaries are not drawn and the {diam} setting is ignored.  If {yes}
is set, the 12 edges of the box are drawn, with a diameter that is a
fraction of the shortest box length in x,y,z (for 3d) or x,y (for 2d).
The color of the box boundaries can be set with the "dump_modify
boxcolor"_dump_modify.html command.

The {axes} keyword determines how the coordinate axes are rendered as
thin cylinders in the image.  If {no} is set, then the axes are not
drawn and the {length} and {diam} settings are ignored.  If {yes} is
set, 3 thin cylinders are drawn to represent the x,y,z axes in colors
red,green,blue.  The origin of these cylinders will be offset from the
lower left corner of the box by 10%.  The {length} setting determines
how long the cylinders will be as a fraction of the respective box
lengths.  The {diam} setting determines their thickness as a fraction
of the shortest box length in x,y,z (for 3d) or x,y (for 2d).

:line

The {shiny} keyword determines how shiny the objects rendered in the
image will appear.  The {sfactor} value must be a value 0.0 <=
{sfactor} <= 1.0, where {sfactor} = 1 is a highly reflective surface
and {sfactor} = 0 is a rough non-shiny surface.

The {ssao} keyword turns on/off a screen space ambient occlusion
(SSAO) model for depth shading.  If {yes} is set, then atoms further
away from the viewer are darkened via a randomized process, which is
perceived as depth.  The calculation of this effect can increase the
cost of computing the image by roughly 2x.  The strength of the effect
can be scaled by the {dfactor} parameter.  If {no} is set, no depth
shading is performed.

A series of JPG or PPM images can be converted into a movie file and
then played as a movie using commonly available tools.

Convert JPG or PPM files into an animated GIF or MPEG or other movie
file:

a) Use the ImageMagick convert program. :ulb,l

% convert *.jpg foo.gif
% convert *.ppm foo.mpg :pre

b) Use QuickTime. :l

Select "Open Image Sequence" under the File menu
Load the images into QuickTime to animate them
Select "Export" under the File menu
Save the movie as a QuickTime movie (*.mov) or in another format

c) Windows-based tool. :ule,l

If someone tells us how to do this via a common Windows-based tool,
we'll post the instructions here.

Play the movie:

a) Use your browser to view an animated GIF movie. :ulb,l

Select "Open File" under the File menu
Load the animated GIF file

b) Use the freely available mplayer tool to view an MPEG movie. :l

% mplayer foo.mpg :pre

c) Use the "Pizza.py"_https://lammps.github.io/pizza "animate
tool"_https://lammps.github.io/pizza/doc/animate.html, which works
directly on a series of image files. :l

a = animate("foo*.jpg") :pre

d) QuickTime and other Windows-based media players can
obviously play movie files directly. :ule,l

[Restrictions:]

To write JPG images, you must use a -DSPPARKS_JPEG switch when
building SPPARKS and link with a JPEG library.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_2 section of the documentation for
details.
