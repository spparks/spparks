dump_one command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump_one :pre

[Examples:]

dump_one :pre

[Description:]

Dump the current state of the lattice to the currently defined dump
file.  This can be useful before or after a run, if the
"dump"_dump.html command itself did not produce a snapshot at the
desired time or state.

The information dumped is determined by the "dump"_dump.html command
which must have been previously specified to use the dump_one command.

[Restrictions:]

This command cannot be used to trigger the very first snapshot written
to the file specified with the "dump"_dump.html command.

[Related commands:]

"dump"_dump.html

[Default:] none
