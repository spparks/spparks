time_sinter_start command :h3

[Syntax:]

time_sinter_start tss :pre

tss = value of time to start the vacancy creation and annihilation event in Monte Carlo sintering simulation :ul

[Examples:]

time_sinter_start 250 :pre

[Description:]

This command sets the time to start the calculation of the vacancy
creation and annihilation event in the sintering application. Prior to
that time the sintering simulation just entails grain growth and pore
migration with virtually no densification. The typical usage would be
as part of a random initialization where the grain structure should
acquire certain size before attempting any densification stage.

[Restrictions:] this should be a positive value

This command can only be used as part of the sintering
application. See the doc pages for the sintering application defined
by the "app_style sinter"_app_sinter.html command for further details.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

The default time to start sintering is 50.
