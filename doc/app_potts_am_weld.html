<H3>app_style potts/am/weld command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>app_style style nspins alpha beta haz
</P>
<LI>style = potts/am/weld 

<LI>nspins = number of possible Potts model spins 

<LI>alpha = controls relative size of melt pool shape at bottom compared to top 

<LI>beta = Bezier control point parameter that defines curvature of melt pool shape through thickness  

<LI>haz = width of the heat affected zone (haz) surrounding the melt pool

<P>The <I>app_style potts/am/weld</I> command uses a subset of the command parameters
used by <I>app_style potts/weld</I> -- additional explanation provided below.  For
an explanation of the above commands and parameters, see
<A HREF = "app_potts_weld.html">potts/weld</A> example.  This application requires melt pool
geometry commands -- per example above and explanation below.
</P>
<P>This application requires rastering commands -- per explanation given below.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "pulse.html">pulse</A> command is disabled in this application.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an application for 2D additive manufacturing simulations and is an
adaptation of <A HREF = "app_potts_weld.html">potts/weld</A>; it can be viewed as a
<A HREF = "app_potts_weld.html">potts/weld</A> model with rastering commands as defined and
used by <A HREF = "app_potts_additive.html">potts_additive</A>. The 2D limitation of this app
derives from the full penetration weld assumption; <I>potts/weld</I>; does not have
a melt pool bottom that naturally occurs in an additive manufacturing build the
<I>z</I>-direction.  Thickness of the lattice in the z-direction is taken as the
plate thickness per description in the <A HREF = "app_potts_weld.html">potts/weld</A>; such
simulations will produce meaningful 3D microstructures.  However, it is
generally more efficient to run 2D calculations with this app using only one
plane of lattice sites.
</P>
<P>Application <I>potts/am/weld</I> command values are all associated with
<A HREF = "app_potts_weld.html">potts/weld</A> and have identical
interpretations/meanings for <I>potts/am/weld</I>.  Some values, e.g.
<I>yp,velocity</I>,  used in <I>potts/weld</I>, have been moved to raster commands.
</P>
<P>The following commands must be used to specify pool geometry:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD ><A HREF = "weld_shape_ellipse.html">weld_shape_ellipse</A></TD><TD > specify elliptical pool shape parameters</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ><A HREF = "weld_shape_teardrop.html">weld_shape_teardrop</A></TD><TD > specify teardrop pool shape parameters 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>The following additional commands are typically used by this application.
A layer must be defined: one of <A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am cartesian_layer</A> 
or <A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am path_layer</A>.  A layer requires 1 to many <A HREF = "am_path.html">am path</A>
or at least 1 <A HREF = "am_pass.html">am pass</A>.  Since this application only runs 1 layer, 
the <I>am build</I> command described below is optional.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "am_pass.html">am pass</A>: Specify pass parameters 
used to construct <I>cartesian_layer</I>. 
</P>
<P><A HREF = "am_path.html">am path</A>: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points on 
a layer; sequence of <I>am path</I>s are used to construct an 
<A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am path_layer</A>.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am cartesian_layer</A>: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from <I>am pass</I> and other parameters. 
</P>
<P><A HREF = "am_build.html">am build</A>: May be used to combinations of layers that comprise a pattern.
</P>
<P><I>NOTE</I>: Because <I>potts/am/weld</I> is intended for <I>2D</I> simulations, only the
first layer, as specified in the <I>am build</I> command, is used; this application
does not simulate multilayer builds.  The examples/potts_additive directory
has input files which illustrate how to use the rastering commands.  
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command should be used to set simulation Monte Carlo temperature.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This application is only compatible with square and square cubic
lattices.  It can only be evolved by a rejection KMC (rKMC) algorithm.
See <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> for more information.
