event_temperatures command :h3

[Syntax:]

event_temperatures Tgg Tpm Tv :pre

Tgg = value of temperature for grain growth in Monte Carlo simulation of sintering 
Tpm = value of temperature for pore migration in Monte Carlo simulation of sintering 
Tv = value of temperature for vacancy creation and annihilation in Monte Carlo simulation of sintering :ul

[Examples:]

event_temperatures 2.0 1.0 15.0 :pre

[Description:]

This command sets the event temperature as used in the sintering application. The typical would be as part of a Boltzmann factor that alters the probabilities of event acceptance and rejection. 

[Restrictions:] these should be positive values. 

This command can only be used as part of the sintering application. See the doc pages for the sintering application defined by the "app_style sinter"_app_sinter.html command for further details.

[Default:]

The default temperatures are 1.0 1.0 15.0.
