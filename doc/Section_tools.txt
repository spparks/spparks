7. Additional tools :h3

SPPARKS is designed to be a Monte Carlo (MC) kernel for performing
kinetic MC or Metropolis MC computations.  Additional pre- and
post-processing steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a
simulation.  This section describes additional tools that may be
useful.

Users can extend SPPARKS by writing diagnostic classes that perform
desired analysis or computations.  See "this
section"_Section_modify.html for more info.

Stitch is the primary mechanism for IO in spparks, at least for 
potts related models for grain growth and additive manufacturing 
simulations.  A python script in tools/stitch/plot_stitch_cut.py 
demonstrates how to read and plot perpendicular cuts/images 
from a spparks simulation.  Sphinx documentation for stitch 
can be built using the doc sources in lib/stitch/docs.

External tools like "ovito"_ovito can also be used 
to visualize outputs -- especially text outputs such as dump files.

The output from potts/quaternion can also be visualized with 
crystalline orientation analysis tools like "orix"_orix or "mtex"_mtex.

Another external toolkit called "Pizza.py"_pizza can be used to setup, analyze,
plot, and visualize data for SPPARKS simulations.  Pizza.py is written
in "Python" and is available for download from "the Pizza.py WWW
site"_pizza.

Addtional scripts below are distributed with spparks under the tools directory.

crystalline_orientations/cpp_quaternion.py: enables reading spparks quaternion header files :l
crystalline_orientations/plot_cubic_symmetry_histograms.py: verification plots for disorientation distribution 
of randomly oriented cubic structures :l
crystalline_orientations/plot_hcp_symmetry_histograms.py: verification plots for disorientation distribution 
of randomly oriented hcp structures :l
