7. Additional tools :h3

SPPARKS is designed to be a Monte Carlo (MC) kernel for performing
kinetic MC or Metropolis MC computations.  Additional pre- and
post-processing steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a
simulation.  This section describes additional tools that may be
useful.

Users can extend SPPARKS by writing diagnostic classes that perform
desired analysis or computations.  See "this
section"_Section_modify.html for more info.

Our group has written and released a separate toolkit called
"Pizza.py"_pizza which provides tools which may be useful for setup,
analysis, plotting, and visualization of SPPARKS simulations.
Pizza.py is written in "Python"_python and is available for download
from "the Pizza.py WWW site"_pizza.
