am build command :h3

[Syntax:]

am build start z num_layers N :pre

start = optional key word
z = specifies elevation in SPPARKS sites of first layer
num_layers = optional keyword
N = specifies number of layers for this build simulation :ul

[Example 1:]

am pass 1 dir X speed 9 hatch 75 :pre
am cartesian_layer 1 start LL pass_id 1 thickness 10 offset -100. 0.0 :pre
am build start 10 num_layers 2 :pre

[Example 2:]

am pass 1 dir X speed 9 hatch 75 :pre
am pass 1 dir Y speed 9 hatch 75 :pre
am cartesian_layer 1 start LL pass_id 1 thickness 10 offset -100. 0.0 :pre
am cartesian_layer 2 start LR pass_id 2 thickness 1 offset 0.0 -100.0 :pre
am build start 10 num_layers 4 :pre

[Description:]

This is an optional command used by
"am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html and
"potts/am/weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html applications to specify
multilayer build simulations.  The command allows for re-use of layer
specifications and implicitly creates a pattern of layers.  The build
pattern is implied by the order and number of layers in the input
script.  As is conventional, the build proceeds in the z-direction
according to specified layer thicknesses.  The {am build start}
parameter specifies the top surface of build plane; its important to
specify this parameter if the spparks domain is thicker than a build
layer otherwise the default value will be {zhi} taken from region box
which is probably not desired.  Once all layers have been
built/simulated, the pattern repeats, cycling through the layers again
and again until {num_layers} have been simulated.  The {am build}
command allows for defining an arbitrary number of layers and
patterns.

This command is mostly intended for SPPARKS simulations that do not
use Stitch IO; nonetheless, this command can be used with Stitch IO.
Simulations using Stitch IO would normally proceed layer-by-layer
using only one layer in any particular simulation.  If this command is
omitted then the pattern of layers in the input script is only
simulated once.

In Example 1, one layer is simulated.  Because {thickness t=10}, {am
build start z=10} is specified.

In Example 2 above, 2 layers are defined but 4 layers are simulated;
layers are alternately rastered in {X} then {Y} directions starting at
the LL corner and alternately the LR corner.  As in Example 1, because
first layer {thickness t=10}, the {start} value is set at {am build
start z=10}.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html "app_style
potts/am/weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html or applications.

[Related commands:]

"am pass"_am_pass.html, "am path"_am_path.html, "am
cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html "am path"_am_path_layer.html

[Default:] 

These are the option defaults:

start z = the z-component of the SPPARKS region box
num_layers = the number of layers in the input script :ul
