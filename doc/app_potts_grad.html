<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an on-lattice application derived from the <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style
potts/neighonly</A> application which applies gradients
given in three directions x,y, and z.  The gradients can be either
temperature or mobility gradients.  If grad_style <I>mob</I> is chosen,
mobility gradients are used.  If grad_style <I>temp</I> is chosen,
temperature gradients are used.
</P>
<P>When the grad_style <I>temp</I> is used, the mobility of each site is
assumed to depend on temperature, according to the equation m0 *
exp(-Q/(KT)), where m0 is the mobility constant, K is Boltzmann's
constant, T is the temperature of the site, and Q is the activation
energy. The temperature of a site depends linearly on its position in
the lattice. The linear function is uniquely defined by the value T0
at the center and the gradients in the x,y, and z directions, grad_x,
grad_y, and grad_z, respectively.  The gradients are in units of
temperature per lattice spacing (defined by the <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A>
constant).
</P>
<P>When the grad_style <I>mob</I> is used each site is assigned a mobility
directly from the mobility gradients.  The arguments Q and T0 are not
used during a mobility gradient simulation.  m0 is the initial
mobility at the center of the domain.  The mobility of each site
depends linearly on its position in the lattice.  The linear function
is defined by the mobility gradients.  The mobility gradients are in
units of mobility per lattice spacing (defined by the
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> constant).
</P>
<P>Under most circumstances a gradient will break periodicity in the
gradient direction.  This app requires a special method for turning
off periodicity.  Refer to the examples under <I>potts_grad</I> for more
details on how to turn periodicity off.
</P>
<P>Convert is an argument multiplied by the given gradients and is used
to convert units as a convenience for the user.
</P>
<P>Grad_z is an optional argument and will default to zero if not
specified.
