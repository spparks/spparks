9. Python interface to SPPARKS :h3

This section describes how to build and use SPPARKS via a Python
interface.

9.1 "Building SPPARKS as a shared library"_#py_1
9.2 "Installing the Python wrapper into Python"_#py_2
9.3 "Extending Python with MPI to run in parallel"_#py_3
9.4 "Testing the Python-SPPARKS interface"_#py_4
9.5 "Using SPPARKS from Python"_#py_5
9.6 "Example Python scripts that use SPPARKS"_#py_6 :ul

The SPPARKS distribution includes the file python/spparks.py which
wraps the library interface to SPPARKS.  This file makes it is
possible to run SPPARKS, invoke SPPARKS commands or give it an input
script, extract SPPARKS results, an modify internal SPPARKS variables,
either from a Python script or interactively from a Python prompt.
You can do the former in serial or parallel.  Running Python
interactively in parallel does not generally work, unless you have a
package installed that extends your Python to enable multiple
instances of Python to read what you type.

"Python"_http://www.python.org is a powerful scripting and programming
language which can be used to wrap software like SPPARKS and other
packages.  It can be used to glue multiple pieces of software
together, e.g. to run a coupled or multiscale model.  See "Section
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_2 of the manual for more ideas about
coupling SPPARKS to other codes.  See "Section_start
4"_Section_start.html#start_5 about how to build SPPARKS as a library,
and "Section_howto 3"_Section_howto.html#howto_3 for a description of
the library interface provided in src/library.cpp and src/library.h
and how to extend it for your needs.  As described below, that
interface is what is exposed to Python.  It is designed to be easy to
add functions to.  This can easily extend the Python inteface as well.
See details below.

By using the Python interface, SPPARKS can also be coupled with a GUI
or other visualization tools that display graphs or animations in real
time as SPPARKS runs.  Examples of such scripts may eventually be
included in the python directory.

Two advantages of using Python are how concise the language is, and
that it can be run interactively, enabling rapid development and
debugging of programs.  If you use it to mostly invoke costly
operations within SPPARKS, such as running a simulation for a
reasonable number of timesteps, then the overhead cost of invoking
SPPARKS thru Python will be negligible.

Before using SPPARKS from a Python script, you need to do two things.
You need to build SPPARKS as a dynamic shared library, so it can be
loaded by Python.  And you need to tell Python how to find the library
and the Python wrapper file python/spparks.py.  Both these steps are
discussed below.  If you wish to run SPPARKS in parallel from Python,
you also need to extend your Python with MPI.  This is also discussed
below.

The Python wrapper for SPPARKS uses the amazing and magical (to me)
"ctypes" package in Python, which auto-generates the interface code
needed between Python and a set of C interface routines for a library.
Ctypes is part of standard Python for versions 2.5 and later.  You can
check which version of Python you have installed, by simply typing
"python" at a shell prompt.

9.1 Building SPPARKS as a shared library :link(py_1),h4

Instructions on how to build SPPARKS as a shared library are given in
"Section_start 5"_Section_start.html#start_5.  A shared library is one
that is dynamically loadable, which is what Python requires.  On Linux
this is a library file that ends in ".so", not ".a".

From the src directory, type

make makeshlib
make -f Makefile.shlib foo :pre

where foo is the machine target name, such as linux or g++ or serial.
This should create the file libspparks_foo.so in the src directory, as
well as a soft link libspparks.so, which is what the Python wrapper will
load by default.  Note that if you are building multiple machine
versions of the shared library, the soft link is always set to the
most recently built version.

If this fails, see "Section_start 5"_Section_start.html#start_5 for
more details, especially if your SPPARKS build uses auxiliary
libraries like MPI which may not be built as shared libraries on your
system.

:line

9.2 Installing the Python wrapper into Python :link(py_2),h4

For Python to invoke SPPARKS, there are 2 files it needs to know about:

python/spparks.py
src/libspparks.so :ul

Spparks.py is the Python wrapper on the SPPARKS library interface.
Libspparks.so is the shared SPPARKS library that Python loads, as
described above.

You can insure Python can find these files in one of two ways:

set two environment variables
run the python/install.py script :ul

If you set the paths to these files as environment variables, you only
have to do it once.  For the csh or tcsh shells, add something like
this to your ~/.cshrc file, one line for each of the two files:

setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/home/sjplimp/spparks/python
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/sjplimp/spparks/src :pre

If you use the python/install.py script, you need to invoke it every
time you rebuild SPPARKS (as a shared library) or make changes to the
python/spparks.py file.

You can invoke install.py from the python directory as

% python install.py \[libdir\] \[pydir\] :pre

The optional libdir is where to copy the SPPARKS shared library to; the
default is /usr/local/lib.  The optional pydir is where to copy the
spparks.py file to; the default is the site-packages directory of the
version of Python that is running the install script.

Note that libdir must be a location that is in your default
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, like /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.  And pydir must be a
location that Python looks in by default for imported modules, like
its site-packages dir.  If you want to copy these files to
non-standard locations, such as within your own user space, you will
need to set your PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables
accordingly, as above.

If the install.py script does not allow you to copy files into system
directories, prefix the python command with "sudo".  If you do this,
make sure that the Python that root runs is the same as the Python you
run.  E.g. you may need to do something like

% sudo /usr/local/bin/python install.py \[libdir\] \[pydir\] :pre

You can also invoke install.py from the make command in the src
directory as

% make install-python :pre

In this mode you cannot append optional arguments.  Again, you may
need to prefix this with "sudo".  In this mode you cannot control
which Python is invoked by root.

Note that if you want Python to be able to load different versions of
the SPPARKS shared library (see "this section"_#py_5 below), you will
need to manually copy files like libspparks_g++.so into the
appropriate system directory.  This is not needed if you set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as described above.

9.3 Extending Python with MPI to run in parallel :link(py_3),h4

If you wish to run SPPARKS in parallel from Python, you need to extend
your Python with an interface to MPI.  This also allows you to
make MPI calls directly from Python in your script, if you desire.

There are several Python packages available that purport to wrap MPI
as a library and allow MPI functions to be called from Python.

These include

"pyMPI"_http://pympi.sourceforge.net/
"maroonmpi"_http://code.google.com/p/maroonmpi/
"mpi4py"_http://code.google.com/p/mpi4py/
"myMPI"_http://nbcr.sdsc.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?t=89&sid=c997fefc3933bd66204875b436940f16
"Pypar"_http://code.google.com/p/pypar :ul

All of these except pyMPI work by wrapping the MPI library and
exposing (some portion of) its interface to your Python script.  This
means Python cannot be used interactively in parallel, since they do
not address the issue of interactive input to multiple instances of
Python running on different processors.  The one exception is pyMPI,
which alters the Python interpreter to address this issue, and (I
believe) creates a new alternate executable (in place of "python"
itself) as a result.

In principle any of these Python/MPI packages should work to invoke
SPPARKS in parallel and MPI calls themselves from a Python script which
is itself running in parallel.  However, when I downloaded and looked
at a few of them, their documentation was incomplete and I had trouble
with their installation.  It's not clear if some of the packages are
still being actively developed and supported.

The one I recommend, since I have successfully used it with SPPARKS, is
Pypar.  Pypar requires the ubiquitous "Numpy
package"_http://numpy.scipy.org be installed in your Python.  After
launching python, type

import numpy :pre

to see if it is installed.  If not, here is how to install it (version
1.3.0b1 as of April 2009).  Unpack the numpy tarball and from its
top-level directory, type

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install :pre

The "sudo" is only needed if required to copy Numpy files into your
Python distribution's site-packages directory.

To install Pypar (version pypar-2.1.4_94 as of Aug 2012), unpack it
and from its "source" directory, type

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install :pre

Again, the "sudo" is only needed if required to copy Pypar files into
your Python distribution's site-packages directory.

If you have successully installed Pypar, you should be able to run
Python and type

import pypar :pre

without error.  You should also be able to run python in parallel
on a simple test script

% mpirun -np 4 python test.py :pre

where test.py contains the lines

import pypar
print "Proc %d out of %d procs" % (pypar.rank(),pypar.size()) :pre

and see one line of output for each processor you run on.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use Pypar and SPPARKS in parallel from Python, you
must insure both are using the same version of MPI.  If you only have
one MPI installed on your system, this is not an issue, but it can be
if you have multiple MPIs.  Your SPPARKS build is explicit about which
MPI it is using, since you specify the details in your lo-level
src/MAKE/Makefile.foo file.  Pypar uses the "mpicc" command to find
information about the MPI it uses to build against.  And it tries to
load "libmpi.so" from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This may or may not find
the MPI library that SPPARKS is using.  If you have problems running
both Pypar and SPPARKS together, this is an issue you may need to
address, e.g. by moving other MPI installations so that Pypar finds
the right one.

:line

9.4 Testing the Python-SPPARKS interface :link(py_4),h4

To test if SPPARKS is callable from Python, launch Python interactively
and type:

>>> from spparks import spparks
>>> spk = spparks() :pre

If you get no errors, you're ready to use SPPARKS from Python.  If the
2nd command fails, the most common error to see is

OSError: Could not load SPPARKS dynamic library :pre

which means Python was unable to load the SPPARKS shared library.  This
typically occurs if the system can't find the SPPARKS shared library or
one of the auxiliary shared libraries it depends on, or if something
about the library is incompatible with your Python.  The error message
should give you an indication of what went wrong.

You can also test the load directly in Python as follows, without
first importing from the spparks.py file:

>>> from ctypes import CDLL
>>> CDLL("libspparks.so") :pre

If an error occurs, carefully go thru the steps in "Section_start
5"_Section_start.html#start_5 and above about building a shared
library and about insuring Python can find the necessary two files
it needs.

[Test SPPARKS and Python in serial:] :h5

To run a SPPARKS test in serial, type these lines into Python
interactively from the examples/ising directory:

>>> from spparks import spparks
>>> spk = spparks()
>>> spk.file("in.ising") :pre

Or put the same lines in the file test.py and run it as

% python test.py :pre

Either way, you should see the results of running the in.ising example
on a single processor appear on the screen, the same as if you had
typed something like:

spk_g++ < in.ising :pre

[Test SPPARKS and Python in parallel:] :h5

To run SPPARKS in parallel, assuming you have installed the
"Pypar"_http://datamining.anu.edu.au/~ole/pypar package as discussed
above, create a test.py file containing these lines:

import pypar
from spparks import spparks
spk = spparks()
spk.file("in.ising")
print "Proc %d out of %d procs has" % (pypar.rank(),pypar.size()),spk
pypar.finalize() :pre

You can then run it in parallel as:

% mpirun -np 4 python test.py :pre

and you should see the same output as if you had typed

% mpirun -np 4 spk_g++ < in.ising :pre

Note that if you leave out the 3 lines from test.py that specify Pypar
commands you will instantiate and run SPPARKS independently on each of
the P processors specified in the mpirun command.  In this case you
should get 4 sets of output, each showing that a SPPARKS run was made
on a single processor, instead of one set of output showing that
SPPARKS ran on 4 processors.  If the 1-processor outputs occur, it
means that Pypar is not working correctly.

Also note that once you import the PyPar module, Pypar initializes MPI
for you, and you can use MPI calls directly in your Python script, as
described in the Pypar documentation.  The last line of your Python
script should be pypar.finalize(), to insure MPI is shut down
correctly.

[Running Python scripts:] :h5

Note that any Python script (not just for SPPARKS) can be invoked in
one of several ways:

% python foo.script
% python -i foo.script
% foo.script :pre

The last command requires that the first line of the script be
something like this:

#!/usr/local/bin/python 
#!/usr/local/bin/python -i :pre

where the path points to where you have Python installed, and that you
have made the script file executable:

% chmod +x foo.script :pre

Without the "-i" flag, Python will exit when the script finishes.
With the "-i" flag, you will be left in the Python interpreter when
the script finishes, so you can type subsequent commands.  As
mentioned above, you can only run Python interactively when running
Python on a single processor, not in parallel.

9.5 Using SPPARKS from Python :link(py_5),h4

The Python interface to SPPARKS consists of a Python "spparks" module,
the source code for which is in python/spparks.py, which creates a
"spparks" object, with a set of methods that can be invoked on that
object.  The sample Python code below assumes you have first imported
the "spparks" module in your Python script, as follows:

from spparks import spparks :pre

These are the methods defined by the spparks module.  If you look
at the file src/library.cpp you will see that they correspond
one-to-one with calls you can make to the SPPARKS library from a C++ or
C or Fortran program.

spk = spparks()           # create a SPPARKS object using the default libspparks.so library
spk = spparks("g++")      # create a SPPARKS object using the libspparks_g++.so library
spk = spparks("",list)    # ditto, with command-line args, e.g. list = \["-echo","screen"\]
spk = spparks("g++",list) :pre

spk.close()              # destroy a SPPARKS object :pre

spk.file(file)           # run an entire input script, file = "in.lj"
spk.command(cmd)         # invoke a single SPPARKS command, cmd = "run 100.0" :pre

xlo = spk.extract(name,type)  # extract a global quantity
                              # name = "boxxlo", "nlocal", "id", "xyz", "site", iarray2", "darray1", etc
		              # type = 0 = int
			      #        1 = int vector
			      #        2 = int array
			      #        3 = double
			      #        4 = double vector
			      #        5 = double array :pre

eng = spk.energy()       # query current energy of system :pre

:line

IMPORTANT NOTE: Currently, the creation of a SPPARKS object from within
spparks.py does not take an MPI communicator as an argument.  There
should be a way to do this, so that the SPPARKS instance runs on a
subset of processors if desired, but I don't know how to do it from
Pypar.  So for now, it runs with MPI_COMM_WORLD, which is all the
processors.  If someone figures out how to do this with one or more of
the Python wrappers for MPI, like Pypar, please let us know and we
will amend these doc pages.

Note that you can create multiple SPPARKS objects in your Python
script, and coordinate and run multiple simulations, e.g.

from spparks import spparks
spk1 = spparks()
spk2 = spparks()
spk1.file("in.file1")
spk2.file("in.file2") :pre

The file() and command() methods allow an input script or single
commands to be invoked.

The extract() method returns values or pointers to data structures
internal to SPPARKS.  See the src/app.cpp file and its extract()
method for a list of what is recognized as "name" arguments.  Other
values could easily be added.

For example, "boxxlo" returns the lower x-bound of the simulation box.
"Nlocal" and "nglobal" return the number of lattice sites owned by a
proc or the total # of lattice sites in the simulation. "Xyz" returns
the Nx3 array of lattice site coordinates.  "Site" and "iarrayN" and
"darrayN" return a vector of integer or floating-point per-site
values.

:line 

As noted above, these Python class methods correspond one-to-one with
the functions in the SPPARKS library interface in src/library.cpp and
library.h.  This means you can extend the Python wrapper via the
following steps:

Add a new interface function to src/library.cpp and
src/library.h. :ulb,l

Rebuild SPPARKS as a shared library. :l

Add a wrapper method to python/spparks.py for this interface
function. :l

You should now be able to invoke the new interface function from a
Python script.  Isn't ctypes amazing? :l,ule

:line
:line

9.6 Example Python scripts that use SPPARKS :link(py_6),h4

These are the Python scripts included as demos in the python/examples
directory of the SPPARKS distribution, to illustrate the kinds of
things that are possible when Python wraps SPPARKS.  If you create your
own scripts, send them to us and we can include them in the SPPARKS
distribution.

trivial.py, read/run a SPPARKS input script thru Python,
demo.py, invoke various SPPARKS library interface routines :tb(c=2)

See the python/README file for instructions on how to run them and the
source code for individual scripts for comments about what they do.
