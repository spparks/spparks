<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_1"></A><B><I>Read this first:</I></B> 

<P>Building SPPARKS can be non-trivial.  You will likely need to edit a
makefile, there are compiler options, additional libraries can be used
(MPI, JPEG), etc.  Please read this section carefully.  If you are not
comfortable with makefiles, or building codes on a Unix platform, or
running an MPI job on your machine, please find a local expert to help
you.
</P>
<A NAME = "start_2_2"></A><B><I>Building a SPPARKS executable:</I></B> 

<P>The src directory contains the C++ source and header files for SPPARKS.
It also contains a top-level Makefile and a MAKE sub-directory with
low-level Makefile.* files for several machines.  From within the src
directory, type "make" or "gmake".  You should see a list of available
choices.  If one of those is the machine and options you want, say 
<I>serial</I> or <I>mpi</I> or <I>linux</I>, then type one of the commands:
</P>
<PRE>make serial
make mpi
gmake linux 
</PRE>
<P>Try the "serial" and "mpi" targets first, since they are generic and
should typically work on any machine, assuming you have the GNU g++
compiler (for the serial version) and MPI installed (for the mpi
version).  
</P>
<P>Note that on a multi-processor or multi-core platform you can launch a
parallel make, by using the "-j" switch with the make command, which
will typically build SPPARKS more quickly.
</P>
<P>If you get no errors and an executable like spk_serial or spk_mpi is
produced, you're done; it's your lucky day.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: You need a C++ compiler that is C++17 compliant to
build SPPARKS.  Almost all current C++ compilers are; you just need to
use a -std=c++17 flag when compiling, as in the
src/MAKE/Makefile.machine files provided with SPPARKS.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_3"></A><B><I>Common errors that can occur when making SPPARKS:</I></B> 

<P>(1) If the make command breaks immediately with errors that indicate
it can't find files with a "*" in their names, this can be because
your machine's make doesn't support wildcard expansion in a makefile.
Try gmake instead of make.  
</P>
<P>(2) Other errors typically occur because the low-level Makefile isn't
setup correctly for your machine.  If your platform is named "foo",
you need to create a Makefile.foo in the MAKE sub-directory.  Use
whatever existing file is closest to your platform as a starting
point.  See the next section for more instructions.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_4"></A><B><I>Editing a new low-level Makefile.foo:</I></B> 

<P>These are the issues you need to address when editing a low-level
Makefile for your machine.  With a couple exceptions, the only portion
of the file you should need to edit is the "System-specific Settings"
section.
</P>
<P>(1) Change the first line of Makefile.foo to include the word "foo"
and whatever other options you set.  This is the line you will see if
you just type "make".  
</P>
<P>(2) The "compiler/linker settings" section lists compiler and linker settings
for your C++ compiler, including path and optimization flags.  You can use g++,
the open-source GNU compiler, which is available on all Unix systems.  You can
also use mpicc which will typically be available if MPI is installed on your
system, though you should check which actual compiler it wraps. You can also
point to a specific compiler; for example see MAKE/Makefile.spencer.gnu where
an environment variable MPI_HOME is used to specify path to mpicxx and mpicc
compilers.  
</P>
<P>Vendor compilers often produce faster code.  On
boxes with Intel CPUs, we suggest using the commercial Intel icc
compiler.
</P>
<P>If building a C++ code on your machine requires additional libraries,
then you should list them as part of the LIB variable.
</P>
<P>The DEPFLAGS setting is what triggers the C++ compiler to create a
dependency list for a source file.  This speeds re-compilation when
source (*.cpp) or header (*.h) files are edited.  Some compilers do
not support dependency file creation, or may use a different switch
than -D.  GNU g++ works with -D.  If your compiler can't create
dependency files (a long list of errors involving *.d files), then
you'll need to create a Makefile.foo patterned after Makefile.storm,
which uses different rules that do not involve dependency files.
</P>
<P>(3) The "system-specific settings" section has 3 parts.
</P>
<P>(3.a) The SPK_INC variable is used to include options that turn on
system-dependent ifdefs within the SPPARKS code.  The settings
that are currently recogized are:
</P>
<UL><LI>-DSPPARKS_GZIP
<LI>-DSPPARKS_JPEG 
<LI>-DSPPARKS_SMALLBIG
<LI>-DSPPARKS_BIGBIG
<LI>-DSPPARKS_SMALLSMALL 
</UL>
<P>The read_sites and dump commands will read/write gzipped files if you
compile with -DSPPARKS_GZIP.  It requires that your Unix support the
"popen" command.
</P>
<P>If you use -DSPPARKS_JPEG, the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump image</A> command will be
able to write out JPEG image files.  If not, it will only be able to
write out text-based PPM image files.  For JPEG files, you must also
link SPPARKS with a JPEG library.  See section (3.c) below for more
details on this.
</P>
<P>Use at most one of the -DSPPARKS_SMALLBIG, -DSPPARKS_BIGBIG,
-DSPPARKS_SMALLSMALL settings.  The default is
-DSPPARKS_SMALLBIG. These settings refer to use of 4-byte (small) vs
8-byte (big) integers within SPPARKS, as specified in src/spktype.h.
The only reason to use the BIGBIG setting is to enable simulation of
systems with more than 2 billion sites.  Normally, the only reason to
use SMALLSMALL is if your machine does not support 64-bit integers.
See the <A HREF = "#start_2_4">Additional build tips</A> section below for more
details on these settings.
</P>
<P>(3.b) The 3 MPI variables are used to specify an MPI library to build
SPPARKS with.
</P>
<P>If you want SPPARKS to run in parallel, you must have an MPI library
installed on your platform.  If you use an MPI-wrapped compiler, such
as "mpicc" to build SPPARKS, you can probably leave these 3 variables
blank.  If you do not use "mpicc" as your compiler/linker, then you
need to specify where the mpi.h file (MPI_INC) and the MPI library
(MPI_PATH) is found and its name (MPI_LIB).
</P>
<P>If you are installing MPI yourself, we recommend MPICH or OpenMPI.  
Both MPICH and OpenMPI can be downloaded and installed for use 
with SPPARKS. 
If you are running on a big parallel platform, your system people or the
vendor should have already installed a version of MPI, which will be
faster than MPICH or OpenMPI, so find out how to build and link
with it.  If you use MPICH or OpenMPI, you will have to
configure and build it for your platform.  The MPI configure script
should have compiler options to enable you to use the same compiler
you are using for the SPPARKS build, which can avoid problems that can
arise when linking SPPARKS to the MPI library.
</P>
<P>If you just want SPPARKS to run on a single processor, you can use the
STUBS library in place of MPI, since you don't need a true MPI library
installed on your system.  See the Makefile.serial file for how to
specify the 3 MPI variables.  You will also need to build the STUBS
library for your platform before making SPPARKS itself.  From the STUBS
dir, type "make" and it will hopefully create a libmpi.a suitable for
linking to SPPARKS.  If this build fails, you will need to edit the
STUBS/Makefile for your platform.
</P>
<P>The file STUBS/mpi.cpp has a CPU timer function MPI_Wtime() that calls
gettimeofday() .  If your system doesn't support gettimeofday() ,
you'll need to insert code to call another timer.  Note that the
ANSI-standard function clock() rolls over after an hour or so, and is
therefore insufficient for timing long SPPARKS simulations.
</P>
<P>(3.c) The 3 JPG variables are used to specify a JPEG library which
SPPARKS uses when writing a JPEG file via the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command.  These can be left blank if you are
not using the -DSPPARKS_JPEG switch discussed above in section (3.a).
</P>
<P>A standard JPEG library usually goes by the name libjpeg.a and has an
associated header file jpeglib.h.  Whichever JPEG library you have on
your platform, you'll need to set the appropriate JPG_INC, JPG_PATH,
and JPG_LIB variables in Makefile.foo so that the compiler and linker
can find it.
</P>
<P>That's it.  Once you have a correct Makefile.foo and you have
pre-built any other libraries it will use (e.g. MPI, JPEG), all you
need to do from the src directory is type one of these 2 commands:
</P>
<P>That's it.  Once you have a correct Makefile.foo and you have
pre-built the MPI library it uses, all you need to do from the src
directory is type one of these 2 commands:
</P>
<PRE>make foo
gmake foo 
</PRE>
<P>You should get the executable spk_foo when the build is complete.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_5"></A><B><I>Additional build tips:</I></B> 

<P>(1) Building SPPARKS for multiple platforms.
</P>
<P>You can make SPPARKS for multiple platforms from the same src
directory.  Each target creates its own object sub-directory called
Obj_name where it stores the system-specific *.o files.
</P>
<P>(2) Cleaning up.
</P>
<P>Typing "make clean" will delete all *.o object files created when
SPPARKS is built.
</P>
<P>(3) Changing the SPPARKS size limits via -DSPPARKS_SMALLBIG or
-DSPPARKS_BIGBIG or -DSPPARKS_SMALLSMALL
</P>
<P>As explained above, any of these 3 settings can be specified on the
SPK_INC line in your low-level src/MAKE/Makefile.foo.
</P>
<P>The default is -DSPPARKS_SMALLBIG which allows for systems with up to
2^31 sites (about 2 billion).  This is because the site IDs are stored
in 32-bit integers.
</P>
<P>To allow for larger systems, compile with -DSPPARKS_BIGBIG.  This
stores site IDs in 64-bit integers.  This enables systems with up to
2^63 sites (about 9e18).
</P>
<P>If your system does not support 8-byte integers, you will need to
compile with the -DSPPARKS_SMALLSMALL setting.  This will restrict the
total number of sites to 2^31 (about 2 billion), as well as store some
simulation statistics in 4-byte integers.
</P>
<P>Note that in src/lmptype.h there are definitions of all these data
types as well as the MPI data types associated with them.  The MPI
types need to be consistent with the associated C data types, or else
SPPARKS will generate a run-time error.  As far as we know, the
settings defined in src/spktype.h are portable and work on every
current system.
</P>
<P>In all cases, the size of problem that can be run on a per-processor
basis is limited by 4-byte integer storage to 2^31 sites per processor
(about 2 billion). This should not normally be a limitation since such
a problem would have a huge per-processor memory and would run very
slowly in terms of CPU secs per Monte Carlo interation.
</P>
<A NAME = "start_2_6"></A><B><I>Building for a Mac:</I></B> 

<P>OS X is BSD Unix, so it already works.  See the Makefile.mac file.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_7"></A><B><I>Building for Windows:</I></B> 

<P>SPPARKS is just C++ with MPI calls, so it should be possible to build
it for a Windows box, either using a Linux installation such as cygwin
(see src/MAKE/Makefile.cygwin), or importing the source files into
Visual Studio C++ and building it there.  For the latter you are on
your own.  The SPPARKS developers do not use Windows.  
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_3"></A>2.3 Making SPPARKS with optional packages 
</H4>
<P>The source code for SPPARKS is structured as a large set of core files
which are always used, plus optional packages, which are groups of
files that enable a specific set of features.  You can see the list of
both standard and user-contributed packages by typing "make package".
</P>
<P>Currently there is only one optional package: STITCH.  It is dicussed
more below.
</P>
<P>Any or all packages can be included or excluded when SPPARKS is built.
You may wish to exclude certain packages if you will never run certain
kinds of simulations.
</P>
<P>By default, SPPARKS includes no packages.
</P>
<P>Packages are included or excluded by typing "make yes-name" or "make
no-name", where "name" is the name of the package.  You can also type
"make yes-all" or "make no-all" to include/exclude all packages.
These commands work by simply moving files back and forth between the
main src directory and sub-directories with the package name, so that
the files are seen or not seen when SPPARKS is built.  After you have
included or excluded a package, you must re-build SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>Additional make options exist to help manage SPPARKS files that exist
in both the src directory and in package sub-directories.  You do not
normally need to use these commands unless you are editing SPPARKS
files or have downloaded a patch from the SPPARKS WWW site.  Typing
"make package-update" will overwrite src files with files from the
package directories if the package has been included.  It should be
used after a patch is installed, since patches only update the master
package version of a file.  Typing "make package-overwrite" will
overwrite files in the package directories with src files.  Typing
"make package-check" will list differences between src and package
versions of the same files.
</P>
<P>2.3.1 STITCH package
</P>
<P>The STITCH package allows SPPARKS to use the Stitch library for I/O,
which is included in the SPPARKS distribution in lib/stitch.  At some
point the Stitch library will have its own website and will also be
downloadable there.
</P>
<P><I>Stitch</I> is an efficient I/O API and database format with a native
python interface.  <I>Stitch</I> files can read in to start a simulation
and/or output during a simulation.  A novel aspect of <I>stitch</I> is that
it enables out-of-core computations by building a simulation domain
analogously to the way an additive manufactured (AM) part is built.
It merges outputs written over time to efficiently construct a much
larger simulation domain that would otherwise be impossible to model
in one simulation.  <I>Stitching</I> workflows can be created to perform
multiple SPPARKS simulations representing an additive manufacturing
process; such simulations can produce huge numbers of lattice sites
representing an entire AM build that would otherwise be impossible to
simulate due to length scale and computational resource limitations.
<I>Stitch</I> is intended and primarily focused on microstructural
evolution simulations such as welding and additive manufacturing but
other applications may be possible.
</P>
<P>Building SPPARKS with the STITCH package enables these commands to use
stitch-related options:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "dump.html">dump stitch</A>
<LI><A HREF = "set.html">set stitch</A>
<LI><A HREF = "reset_time.html">reset_time</A> 
</UL>
<P>See the am_path and stitch sub-directories in the
examples directory for models and scripts which use the Stitch
library.
</P>
<P>You can build SPPARKS with <I>stitch</I> support in one of 3 ways.
</P>
<P>(1) From the src directory using make
</P>
<PRE>% cd spparks/src
% make lib-stitch args="-b"   # build the Stitch library and set links to it
% make yes-stitch             # install the STITCH package
% make mpi                    # or whichever machine target you wish 
</PRE>
<P>(2) From the lib directory using Install.py
</P>
<PRE>% cd spparks/lib
% python Install.py -b        # build the Stitch library and set links to it
% cd spparks/src
% make yes-stitch             # install the STITCH package
% make mpi                    # or whichever machine target you wish 
</PRE>
<P>(3) Manual build of the Stitch library you have downloaded to your system
</P>
<PRE>% cd $STITCHDIR                # STITCHDIR = the Stitch library directory
% make                         # build Stitch with default Makefile
% make -f Makefile.custom      # build Stitch with custom Makefile
% cd spparks/lib/stitch
% ln -s $STITCHDIR liblink     # set two links in SPPARKS lib/stitch
% ln -s $STITCHDIR includelink
% cd spparks/src
% make yes-stitch              # install the STITCH package
% make mpi                     # or whichever machine target you wish 
</PRE>
<P>To un-install the STITCH package from SPPARKS, do the following:
</P>
<PRE>% cd spparks/src
% make no-stitch     # un-install the STITCH package files
% make mpi           # re-build SPPARKS w/out the STITCH package 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_4"></A>2.4 Building SPPARKS as a library 
</H4>
<P>SPPARKS can be built as either a static or shared library, which can
then be called from another application or a scripting language.  See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_2">this section</A> for more info on coupling
SPPARKS to other codes.  See <A HREF = "Section_python.html">this section</A> for
more info on wrapping and running SPPARKS from Python.
</P>
<H5><B>Static library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>To build SPPARKS as a static library (*.a file on Linux), type
</P>
<PRE>make makelib
make -f Makefile.lib foo 
</PRE>
<P>where foo is the machine name.  This kind of library is typically used
to statically link a driver application to SPPARKS, so that you can
insure all dependencies are satisfied at compile time.  Note that
inclusion or exclusion of any desired optional packages should be done
before typing "make makelib".  The first "make" command will create a
current Makefile.lib with all the file names in your src dir.  The
second "make" command will use it to build SPPARKS as a static
library, using the ARCHIVE and ARFLAGS settings in
src/MAKE/Makefile.foo.  The build will create the file
libspparks_foo.a which another application can link to.
</P>
<H5><B>Shared library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>To build SPPARKS as a shared library (*.so file on Linux), which can
be dynamically loaded, e.g. from Python, type
</P>
<PRE>make makeshlib
make -f Makefile.shlib foo 
</PRE>
<P>where foo is the machine name.  This kind of library is required when
wrapping SPPARKS with Python; see <A HREF = "Section_python.html">Section_python</A>
for details.  Again, note that inclusion or exclusion of any desired
optional packages should be done before typing "make makelib".  The
first "make" command will create a current Makefile.shlib with all the
file names in your src dir.  The second "make" command will use it to
build SPPARKS as a shared library, using the SHFLAGS and SHLIBFLAGS
settings in src/MAKE/Makefile.foo.  The build will create the file
libspparks_foo.so which another application can link to dyamically.
It will also create a soft link libspparks.so, which the Python
wrapper uses by default.
</P>
<P>Note that for a shared library to be usable by a calling program, all
the auxiliary libraries it depends on must also exist as shared
libraries.  This will be the case for libraries included with SPPARKS,
such as the dummy MPI library in src/STUBS since they are always built
as shared libraries with the -fPIC switch.  However, if a library like
MPI does not exist as a shared library, the second make command will
generate an error.  This means you will need to install a shared
library version of the package.  The build instructions for the
library should tell you how to do this.
</P>
<H5><B>Additional requirement for using a shared library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>The operating system finds shared libraries to load at run-time using
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  So you may wish to copy the
file src/libspparks.so or src/libspparks_g++.so (for example) to a place
the system can find it by default, such as /usr/local/lib, or you may
wish to add the SPPARKS src directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the
current version of the shared library is always available to programs
that use it.
</P>
<P>For the csh or tcsh shells, you would add something like this to your
~/.cshrc file:
</P>
<PRE>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $<I>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</I>:/home/sjplimp/spparks/src 
</PRE>
<H5><B>Calling the SPPARKS library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>Either flavor of library (static or shared0 allows one or more SPPARKS
objects to be instantiated from the calling program.
</P>
<P>When used from a C++ program, all of SPPARKS is wrapped in a SPPARKS_NS
namespace; you can safely use any of its classes and methods from
within the calling code, as needed.
</P>
<P>When used from a C or Fortran program or a scripting language like
Python, the library has a simple function-style interface, provided in
src/library.cpp and src/library.h.
</P>
<P>See the sample codes in examples/COUPLE/simple for examples of C++ and
C and Fortran codes that invoke SPPARKS thru its library interface.
There are other examples as well in the COUPLE directory which are
discussed in <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_2">Section_howto 2</A> of the
manual.  See <A HREF = "Section_python.html">Section_python</A> of the manual for a
description of the Python wrapper provided with SPPARKS that operates
through the SPPARKS library interface.
</P>
<P>The files src/library.cpp and library.h define the C-style API for
using SPPARKS as a library.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_3">Section_howto
3</A> of the manual for a description of the
interface and how to extend it for your needs.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_5"></A>2.5 Running SPPARKS 
</H4>
<P>By default, SPPARKS runs by reading commands from stdin;
e.g. spk_linux < in.file.  This means you first create an input script
(e.g. in.file) containing the desired commands.  <A HREF = "Section_commands.html">This
section</A> describes how input scripts are
structured and what commands they contain.
</P>
<P>You can test SPPARKS on any of the sample inputs provided in the
examples directory.  Input scripts are named in.* and sample outputs
are named log.*.name.P where name is a machine and P is the number of
processors it was run on.
</P>
<P>Here is how you might run the Potts model tests on a Linux box, using
mpirun to launch a parallel job:
</P>
<PRE>cd src
make linux
cp spk_linux ../examples/lj
cd ../examples/potts
mpirun -np 4 spk_linux < in.potts 
</PRE>
<P>The screen output from SPPARKS is described in a section below.  As it
runs, SPPARKS also writes a log.spparks file with the same
information.
</P>
<P>Note that this sequence of commands copies the SPPARKS executable
(spk_linux) to the directory with the input files.  This may not be
necessary, but some versions of MPI reset the working directory to
where the executable is, rather than leave it as the directory where
you launch mpirun from (if you launch spk_linux on its own and not
under mpirun).  If that happens, SPPARKS will look for additional
input files and write its output files to the executable directory,
rather than your working directory, which is probably not what you
want.
</P>
<P>If SPPARKS encounters errors in the input script or while running a
simulation it will print an ERROR message and stop or a WARNING
message and continue.  See <A HREF = "Section_errors.html">this section</A> for a
discussion of the various kinds of errors SPPARKS can or can't detect,
a list of all ERROR and WARNING messages, and what to do about them.
</P>
<P>SPPARKS can run a problem on any number of processors, including a
single processor.  SPPARKS can run as large a problem as will fit in
the physical memory of one or more processors.  If you run out of
memory, you must run on more processors or setup a smaller problem.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_6"></A>2.6 Command-line options 
</H4>
<P>At run time, SPPARKS recognizes several optional command-line switches
which may be used in any order.  For example, spk_ibm might be
launched as follows:
</P>
<PRE>mpirun -np 16 spk_ibm -var f tmp.out -log my.log -screen none < in.alloy 
</PRE>
<P>These are the command-line options:
</P>
<PRE>-echo style 
</PRE>
<P>Set the style of command echoing.  The style can be <I>none</I> or <I>screen</I>
or <I>log</I> or <I>both</I>.  Depending on the style, each command read from
the input script will be echoed to the screen and/or logfile.  This
can be useful to figure out which line of your script is causing an
input error.  The default value is <I>log</I>.  The echo style can also be
set by using the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo</A> command in the input script itself.
</P>
<PRE>-partition 8x2 4 5 ... 
</PRE>
<P>Invoke SPPARKS in multi-partition mode.  When SPPARKS is run on P
processors and this switch is not used, SPPARKS runs in one partition,
i.e. all P processors run a single simulation.  If this switch is
used, the P processors are split into separate partitions and each
partition runs its own simulation.  The arguments to the switch
specify the number of processors in each partition.  Arguments of the
form MxN mean M partitions, each with N processors.  Arguments of the
form N mean a single partition with N processors.  The sum of
processors in all partitions must equal P.  Thus the command
"-partition 8x2 4 5" has 10 partitions and runs on a total of 25
processors.
</P>
<P>The input script specifies what simulation is run on which partition;
see the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> and <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> commands.  This
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_4">howto section</A> gives examples of how to use
these commands in this way.  
</P>
<PRE>-in file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file to use as an input script.  This is an optional switch
when running SPPARKS in one-partition mode.  If it is not specified,
SPPARKS reads its input script from stdin - e.g. spk_linux < in.run.
This is a required switch when running SPPARKS in multi-partition
mode, since multiple processors cannot all read from stdin.
</P>
<PRE>-log file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a log file for SPPARKS to write status information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, SPPARKS writes to the
file log.spparks.  If this switch is used, SPPARKS writes to the
specified file.  In multi-partition mode, if the switch is not used, a
log.SPPARKS file is created with hi-level status information.  Each
partition also writes to a log.SPPARKS.N file where N is the partition
ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode, the hi-level
logfile is named "file" and each partition also logs information to a
file.N.  For both one-partition and multi-partition mode, if the
specified file is "none", then no log files are created.  Using a
<A HREF = "log.html">log</A> command in the input script will override this setting.
</P>
<PRE>-screen file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file for SPPARKS to write its screen information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, SPPARKS writes to the
screen.  If this switch is used, SPPARKS writes to the specified file
instead and you will see no screen output.  In multi-partition mode,
if the switch is not used, hi-level status information is written to
the screen.  Each partition also writes to a screen.N file where N is
the partition ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode,
the hi-level screen dump is named "file" and each partition also
writes screen information to a file.N.  For both one-partition and
multi-partition mode, if the specified file is "none", then no screen
output is performed.
</P>
<PRE>-var name value 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a variable that will be defined for substitution purposes when
the input script is read.  "Name" is the variable name which can be a
single character (referenced as $x in the input script) or a full
string (referenced as ${abc}).  The value can be any string.  Using
this command-line option is equivalent to putting the line "variable
name index value" at the beginning of the input script.  Defining a
variable as a command-line argument overrides any setting for the same
variable in the input script, since variables cannot be re-defined.
See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for more info on defining
variables and <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#3_2">this section</A> for more info
on using variables in input scripts.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "start_7"></A>2.7 SPPARKS screen output 
</H4>
<P>As SPPARKS reads an input script, it prints information to both the
screen and a log file about significant actions it takes to setup a
simulation.  When the simulation is ready to begin, SPPARKS performs
various initializations and prints the amount of memory (in MBytes per
processor) that the simulation requires.  An example output is shown
here, for the examples/in.potts script run on 4 processors.

<P>During the run itself, statistical information is printed
periodically, for every delta of simulation time, as specified by the

prints final statistical info and a total run time for the simulation.
