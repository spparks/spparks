deposition command :h3

[Syntax:]

deposition mode rate dirx diry dirz d0 lo hi :pre

mode = off or event or batch
rate = rate of atom deposition (atom/sec units)
dirx,diry,dirz = vector in direction of incidence
d0 = capture distance (distance units)
lo,hi = min/max coordination number of deposition site :ul

[Examples:]

deposition	 event 1.0 0 -1 0 1.0 1 4 
deposition	 batch 1.0 1 1 -1 1.0 3 10
deposition       off :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes deposition events in an on-lattice diffusion
model, specified by the "app_style diffusion"_app_diffusion.html
command.

If *mode* is set to *off*, then no additional arguments are used.
Deposition is turned off.  This can be useful when deposition
previously took place, but is now turned off.

If *mode* is set to *event*, then deposition events will be performed
in tandem with diffusive hop events in the KMC diffusion model.  This
option only works when running on a single processor.

If *mode* is set to *batch*, then deposition events will be performed
as a batch at the end of each KMC loop over sectors.  Thus diffusive
events and deposition events are separated.  This option only works
when running in parallel on multiple processors.

For each trial deposition, a random starting point at the top of the
simulation box is selected (top y surface in 2d, top z surface in 3d).
The atom trajectory (straight line) is traced along its incident
direction which is specified by (dirx,diry,dirz) and need not be a
unit vector.  However, diry < 0 and dirz = 0 is required for 2d
models.  Similarly, dirz < 0 is required for 3d models.

Candidate deposition sites are vacant sites within a perpendicular
distance {d0} from the incident trajectory which also have a current
coordination number C such that {lo} <= C <= {hi}.  Note that {d0} is
specified in distance units which will depend on how the lattice of
sites is defined via the "lattice"_lattice.html command.  For example,
if the lattice constant or box size in specified in Angstroms, then
the distance units for this command are Angstroms as well.

If the inicident angle is not vertical, then periodic images of the
starting point with associated incident trajectories are considered
and the {d0} capture distance is applied to whichever trajectory the
candidate site is closest to, in a perpendicular sense.  This means
x-periodicity in 2d and x- and y-periodicity in 3d.

For the set of candidate sites, the selected deposition site is the
one closest to the starting point, measuring the distance from the
projected perpendicular point to the starting point.

IMPORTANT NOTE: "App_style diffusion"_app_diffusion.html defines valid
sites as vacant (site value = 1) or occupied (value = 2).  When
performing deposition, a row (2d) or plane (3d) of sites at the top of
the system (where the deposited atoms are incident from) should be set
to a value of 3.  This prevents those sites from being considered as
candidate deposition sites, due to them being neighbors of occupied
sites at the bottom of the system in a periodic sense.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html application.

The default is mode = off.
