am path command :h3

[Syntax:]

am path id start x0 y0 end x1 y1 speed V :pre

id = integer identification number for this path
start = required keyword
x0 y0 = starting point x-y plane for straight line path
end = required keyword
x1 y1 = end point x-y plane for straight line path
speed = required keyword
V = scan speed of the pass in sites/Monte-Carlo-sweep :ul

[Example ]

# Convenience; define set of points to be used in path commands
variable X0 equal         0.0
variable Y0 equal         0.0
variable X1 equal        500.0
variable Y1 equal        500.0
variable X2 equal        106.1
variable Y2 equal         0.0
variable X3 equal        500.0
variable Y3 equal        393.9 :pre

am path 2 start ${X3} ${Y3} end ${X2} ${Y2} speed 9

[Description:]

This command is used by "am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html, and
"potts/am_weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html to specify raster scans in a
very general way.  This {am path} command specifies a line in the x-y
plane using {start x,y} and {end x,y} points; path scan {speed V} is
also part of the specification.  Any number of {am path}s can be
specified in a script; an {am path} can be associated with multiple
{am path_layer}s.  The direction of travel is implied by starting and
ending points.

The example commands above define two paths both each of which are
associated with {am path_layer 1}. See depiction of simulation below.

[Restrictions:]

This rastering command can be used with "app_style
potts/am/weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html or "app_style
am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html.

[Related commands:]

The {am path} is a required element of
"am_path_layer"_am_path_layer.html

[Default:] none
