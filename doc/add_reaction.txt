add_reaction command :h3

[Syntax:]

add_reaction reactant1 reactant2 rate product1 product2 ... :pre

reactant1,reactant2 = 0, 1, or 2 reactant species
rate = reaction rate (see units below)
product1, product2 = 0, 1, or more product species :ul

[Examples:]

add_reaction A B 1.0e10 C
add_reaction 1.0 d
add_reaction b2 1.0e-10 c3 d4 e3 :pre

[Description:]

This command defines a chemical reaction for use in the "app_style
chemistry"_app_chemistry.html application.

Each reaction has 0, 1, or 2 reactants.  It also has 0, 1, or more
products.  The reactants and products are specified by species ID
strings, as defined by the "add_species"_add_species.html command.

The units of the specified rate constant depend on how many reactants
participate in the reaction:

0 reactants = rate is molarity/sec
1 reactant = rate is 1/sec
2 reactants = rate is 1/molarity-sec :ul

Thus the first reaction listed above represents an A and B molecule
binding to form a complex C at a rate of 1.0e10 per molarity per
second.  I.e. A + B -> C.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
chemistry"_app_chemistry.html application.
