[Description:]

Define a lattice for use by other commands. In SPPARKS, a lattice is
simply a set of points in space, determined by a unit cell with basis
atoms, that is replicated infinitely in all dimensions. The arguments
of the lattice command can be used to define a wide variety of
crystallographic lattices.

A lattice is used by SPPARKS in two ways. First, the
"create_sites"_create_sites.html command creates "sites" on the
lattice points inside the simulation box. Sites are used by an
on-lattice or off-lattice application, specified by the
"app_style"_app_style.html command, which define events that change
the values associated with sites (e.g. a spin flip) or the coordinates
of the site itself (for off-lattice applications).

Second, the lattice spacing in the x,y,z dimensions is
used by other commands such as the "region"_region.html command
to define distance units and define geometric extents, for
example in specifying the size of the simulation box via
the "create_box"_create_box.html command.

The lattice style must be consistent with the dimension of the
simulation - see the "dimension"_dimension.html command and
descriptions of each style below.

A lattice consists of a unit cell, a set of basis sites within that
cell. The vectors a1,a2,a3 are the edge vectors of the unit cell. This
is the nomenclature for "primitive" vectors in solid-state
crystallography, but in SPPARKS the unit cell they determine does not
have to be a "primitive cell" of minimum volume.

For on-lattice applications (see the "app_style"_app_style.html
command), the lattice definition also infers a connectivity between
lattice sites, which is used to generate the list of neighbors of each
site.  This information is ignored for off-lattice applications.  This
means that for a 2d off-lattice application, it makes no difference
whether a {sq/4n} or {sq/8n} lattice is used; they both simply
generate a square lattice of points.

:line

In the style descriptions that follow, a = the lattice constant
defined by the lattice command.  Sites within a unit cell are defined
as (x,y,z) where 0.0 <= x,y,z < 1.0.

A lattice of style {line/2n} is a 1d lattice with a1 = a 0 0 and one
basis site per unit cell at (0,0,0).  Each lattice point has 2
neighbors.

Lattices of style {sq/4n} and {sq/8n} are 2d lattices with a1 = a 0 0
and a2 = 0 a 0, and one basis site per unit cell at (0,0,0).  The
{sq/4n} style has 4 neighbors per site (east/west/north/south); the
{sq/8n} style has 8 neighbors per site (same 4 as {sq/4n} plus 4
corner points).

A lattice of style {tri} is a 2d lattice with a1 = a 0 0 and a2 = 0
sqrt(3)*a 0, and two basis sites per unit cell at (0,0,0) and
(0.5,0.5,0).  Each lattice points has 6 neighbors.

Lattices of style {sc/6n} and {sc/26n} are 3d lattices with a1 = a 0 0
and a2 = 0 a 0 and a3 = 0 0 a, and one basis site per unit cell at
(0,0,0).  The {sc/6n} style has 6 neighbors per site
(east/west/north/south/up/down); the {sc/26n} style has 26 neighbors per
site (surrounding cube including edge and corner points).

Lattices of style {bcc} and {fcc} and {diamond} are 3d lattice with a1
= a 0 0 and a2 = 0 a 0 and a3 = 0 0 a.  There are two basis sites per
unit cell for {bcc}, 4 basis sites for {fcc}, and 8 sites for
{diamond}.  The location of the basis sites are defined in any
solid-state physics or crystallography text.  The {bcc} style has 8
neighbors per site, the {fcc} has 12, and the {diamond} has 4.

A lattice of style {fcc/octa/tetra} is a 3d lattice with a1 = a 0 0
and a2 = 0 a 0 and a3 = 0 0 a.  There are 16 basis sites per unit
cell, which consist of 4 fcc sites plus 4 octahedral and 8 tetrahedral
interstitial sites.  Again, these are defined in solid-state physics
texts.  There are 26 neighbors per fcc and octahedral site, and 14
neihbors per tetrahedral site.  More specifically, the neighbors
are as follows:

neighbors of each fcc site: 12 fcc, 6 octa, 8 tetra
neighbors of each octa site: 6 fcc, 12 octa, 8 tetra
neighbors of each tetra site: 4 fcc, 4 octa, 6 tetra :ul

The {random} lattice styles are 1d, 2d, and 3d lattices with a1 = 1 0
0 and a2 = 0 1 0 and a3 = 0 0 1.  Note that no {scale} parameter is
defined and the unit cell is a unit cube, not a cube with side length
{a}.  Thus a "region"_region.html command using one of these lattices
will define its geometric region directly, not as multiples of the
{scale} parameter.  When the "create_sites"_create_sites.html command
is used, it will generate a collection of Nrandom points within the
corresponding 1d, 2d, or 3d region or simulation box.  The number of
neighbors per site is defined by the specified {cutoff} parameter.
Two sites I,J will be neighbors of each other if they are closer than
the {cutoff} distance apart.

:line

The command "lattice none" can be used to turn off a previous lattice
definition.  Any command that attempts to use the lattice directly
will then generate an error.  No additional arguments need be used
with "lattice none".
