inclusion command :h3

[Syntax:]

inclusion x y z r :pre

x,y,z = position of center of protein inclusion
r = radius of the protein :ul

[Examples:]

inclusion 10 12 0.0 2.0
inclusion 10 12 5.4 5.0 :pre

[Description:]

This command defines protein sites on a lattice and can only be used
by "app_style membrane"_app_membrane.html applications.

Think of the protein as a sphere (or circle) centered at {x,y,z} and
with a radius of {r}.  All lattice sites within the sphere (or circle)
will be flagged as protein (as opposed to lipid or solvent).  For
lattices with a 2d geometry, the z value should be speficied as 0.0.

[Restrictions:] none

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
pore"_app_pore.html applications.

[Related commands:]

[Default:] none
