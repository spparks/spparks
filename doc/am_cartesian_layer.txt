am cartesian_layer command :h3

[Syntax:]

am cartesian_layer layer_id start location pass_id p_id thickness t offset x,y serpentine switch :pre

layer_id = integer identification number for this cartesian_layer
start = required keyword
location = LL or LR or UR or UL
pass_id = required keyword
p_id = integer ID of the pass to use for this layer
thickness = required keyword
t = thickness in sites of layer
offset = optional keyword and x,y values
x,y = optional relative offset (shift) in x-y plane of raster starting position
serpentine = optional keyword and switch value
switch = 0 for parallel, 1 for anti-parallel of consecutive scans :ul

[Examples:]

# Example 1
am pass 1 dir X speed 9 hatch 75
am cartesian_layer 1 start LL pass_id 1 thickness 1 offset -100. 0.0 :pre

# Example 2
am pass 2 dir Y speed 9 hatch 75
am cartesian_layer 1 start LR pass_id 2 thickness 1 offset 0.0 -100.  :pre

[Description:]

This command is used by "am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html, and
"potts/am/weld"_app_potts_am_weld.html applications to specify raster
patterns on cartesian build layers.  Multiple cartesian_layers can be
defined in a single input file, using unique id values.

The {start location}, references the lower left LL, lower right LR,
upper right UR, upper left UL of the rectangular domain; {location}
must be one of {LL,LR,UR,UL}.  The extent of the rectangular domain
created by the raster pattern is specified elsewhere
("region"_region.html) using {region box} in the standard way.

The {pass_id p_id} specified must reference an "am
pass"_pass_am_pass.html from earlier in the input script.

The build layer {thickness} is specified in units of sites.

Specified in units of sites, {offset} specifies the raster scan
starting position relative to {start location}.

By default, scan patterns are anti-parallel {serpentine}.  To turn off
the default scan pattern add the optional switch {serpentine 0}.

The initial heading of the scan pattern depends upon {start} and the
value of {pass dir} (see "am pass"_am_pass.html); also see examples
below.

In the examples, two unique layers are created. {offset} option is
used to extend starting and ending points of pass, effectively
lengthening the pass; although offset consists of {x,y} values, it is
primarily intended to change starting and ending points along {dir},
ie only one component of {offset} is non-zero; although {offset}
defaults to {x=0,y=0}, if one of these values must be non-zero, then
{0.0} must be given for the other value.

{serpentine 0} must be given to turn {serpentine} off.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of apps
"am/ellipsoid"_app_am_ellipsoid.html or

[Default:] 

The defaults are offset x = 0.0, y = 0.0 and serpentine switch = 0.0.
