<H3>app_style sinter command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style 
</PRE>
<P>style = <I>sinter</I> 
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>app_style sinter
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is on-lattice application which evolve a N-state Ising model or Potts
model of sintering. Each lattice site has a spin value from -1 to N, with
values of 0 representing internal pores sites, positive values representing
grain sites and values of -1 representing the space outside the sintering
compact.  Sites change their spin to simulate microstructural evolution during
sintering.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site i is as follows:
</P>
<P>Hi = Sum_j delta_ij 
</P>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site i and
delta_ij is 0 if the spin of sites i and j are the same and 1 if they
are different.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.
</P>
<P>A complete description of the sintering model and its parameters can be found in the paper: 
</P>
<P>Numerical simulation of microstructural evolution during sintering at the
mesoscale in a 3D powder compact, V. Tikare, M. Braginsky, D. Bouvard and A.
Vagnon, Comp. Mater. Sci., 48[2], 317-325, (2010).
</P>
<P>This application mainly performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped. See <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style pots</A> for an Ising
model, which performs Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is flipped on a single
site.
</P>
<P>As currently implemented, this application can be evolved only by the rejection
KMC (rKMC) algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method to be used with
the application via the <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> command.
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, three different events are programmed: grain
growth, pore migration and vacancy creation and annihilation.  If the site
selected is a grain site, a grain growth event is attempted: a new spin is
chosen randomly from the values held by neighbor grain sites. If the site
selected is a pore site, a pore migration or a vacancy creation and
annihilation event is attempted. For the pore migration event, a new spin is
chosen from the values held by neighboring grain sites such that the flip
results in the minimum possible energy. For a vacancy creation and annihilation
event, a pore site is moved to a neighboring grain site such that the resulting
pore site is completely surrounded by grain sites (vacancy creation at grain
boundary) with the subsequent movement of the vacancy to the surface of the
sintering compact. In all the events, dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as
is a uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected. T is the temperature for simulating
the event, so there is one temperature for grain growth, another for pore
migration and a third temperature for vacancy creation and annihilation. These
temperatures are defined by <A HREF = "event_temperatures.html">event_temperatures</A>
command (which includes the Boltzmann constant k implicitly). 
</P>
<P>Parallel implementation of the Monte Carlo model of sintering using the SPPARKS code is described in: 
</P>
<P>Parallel simulation of 3D sintering, C. Garcia Cardona, V. Tikare and S. J. Plimpton, IJCMSSE, 4[1], 37-54, (2011). 
</P>
<P><B>Initialization:</B>
</P>
<P>There are two methods to initialize the simulation space: randomly or from a spins file.
</P>
<PRE>To do it randomly use the commands:
set i1 unique 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>set i1 value 0 fraction p 
</UL>
<P>The first command sets the spin of each site in the simulation space to a
different value. The second command sets a fraction p of the spins to value 0,
i.e. it defines the initial porosity of the sample. In this case, allow the
grain structure to grow before starting sintering. This can be done by
increasing the time to start the vacancy creation and annihilation event, using
the <A HREF = "time_sinter_start.html">time_sinter_start</A> command.
</P>
<PRE>To read from a spins file use the command:
read_sites filename 
</PRE>
<P>In this case the initial configuration of spins is read directly from the file.
See the documentation for the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command. You should
have defined previously the size of the corresponding simulation region and box
by using the commands: <A HREF = "region.html">region</A>, <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> and
<A HREF = "create_sites.htm">create_sites</A>
