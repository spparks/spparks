<H3>app_style sinter command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style 
</PRE>
<P>style = <I>sinter</I> 
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>app_style sinter
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is on-lattice application which evolve a N-state Ising model or
Potts model of sintering. Each lattice site has a spin value from -1
to N, with values of 0 representing internal pores sites, positive
values representing grain sites and values of -1 representing the
space outside the sintering compact.  Sites change their spin to
simulate microstructural evolution during sintering.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site i is as follows:
</P>
<P>Hi = Sum_j delta_ij 
</P>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site i and
delta_ij is 0 if the spin of sites i and j are the same and 1 if they
are different.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.
</P>
<P>A complete description of the sintering model and its parameters can
be found in the <A HREF = "#Tikare">2010 Tikare, et.al. paper below</A>.
</P>
<P>This application mainly performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins
on two neighboring sites are swapped. See <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style
pots</A> for an Ising model, which performs Glauber
dynamics, meaning the spin is flipped on a single site.
</P>
<P>As currently implemented, this application can be evolved only by the
rejection KMC (rKMC) algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping
method to be used with the application via the <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A>
command.
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, three different events are
programmed: grain growth, pore migration and vacancy creation and
annihilation.  If the site selected is a grain site, a grain growth
event is attempted: a new spin is chosen randomly from the values held
by neighbor grain sites. If the site selected is a pore site, a pore
migration or a vacancy creation and annihilation event is
attempted. For the pore migration event, a new spin is chosen from the
values held by neighboring grain sites such that the flip results in
the minimum possible energy. For a vacancy creation and annihilation
event, a pore site is moved to a neighboring grain site such that the
resulting pore site is completely surrounded by grain sites (vacancy
creation at grain boundary) with the subsequent movement of the
vacancy to the surface of the sintering compact. In all the events, dE
= Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random number R
between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected. T is the temperature for
simulating the event, so there is one temperature for grain growth,
another for pore migration and a third temperature for vacancy
creation and annihilation. These temperatures are defined by
<A HREF = "event_temperatures.html">event_temperatures</A> command (which includes
the Boltzmann constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>Parallel implementation of the Monte Carlo model for sintering in
SPPARKS code is described in the <A HREF = "#Garcia-Cardona">2011 Garcia-Cardona paper
below</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Initialization:</B>
</P>
<P>There are two methods to initialize the simulation space: randomly or
from a file.
</P>
<P>To do it randomly use the commands:
</P>
<PRE>set i1 unique 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>set i1 value 0 fraction p 
</UL>
<P>The first command sets the spin of each site in the simulation space
to a different value. The second command sets a fraction p of the
spins to value 0, i.e. it defines the initial porosity of the
sample. In this case, allow the grain structure to grow before
starting sintering. This can be done by increasing the time to start
the vacancy creation and annihilation event, using the
<A HREF = "time_sinter_start.html">time_sinter_start</A> command.
</P>
<P>To do it from a file:
</P>
<P>See the documentation for the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A>
command. You should have defined previously the size of the
corresponding simulation region and box by using the commands:
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A>, <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> and
<A HREF = "create_sites.htm">create_sites</A>

<LI><A HREF = "diag_sinter_pore_curvature.html">sinter_pore_curvature</A> - calculate pore curvature of the porous compact 
</UL>
<P>Use of the pore curvature to determine the sintering stress is
described in the <A HREF = "#Garcia-Cardona2">2012 Garcia-Cardona paper below</A>.
