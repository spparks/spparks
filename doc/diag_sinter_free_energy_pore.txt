diag_style sinter_free_energy_pore command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style sinter_free_energy_pore keyword value keyword value ... :pre

sinter_free_energy_pore = style name of this diagnostic
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to a diagnostic command :ul

[Examples:]

diag_style sinter_free_energy_pore :pre

[Description:]

The sinter free energy pore diagnostic computes the surface area of the pores in the powder compact simulated. The calculation is done over the 1/27th central parallelepiped in order to avoid border effects. To obtain a measure independent of the size of the simulation the value computed is normalized by dividing over the volume used. The pore free energy is printed as stats output via the The density is printed as stats output via the "stats"_stats.html command.

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used for the sintering application.
